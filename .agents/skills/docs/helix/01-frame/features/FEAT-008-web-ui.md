# Feature: DDx Server Web UI

**ID:** FEAT-008
**Status:** Complete
**Priority:** P1
**Owner:** DDx Team

## Overview

The DDx server (`ddx-server`) serves a web UI for browsing documents, beads,
the document dependency graph, and DDx agent invocation activity. The UI is a
SvelteKit application built with Svelte 5, embedded into the Go binary via `embed.FS`,
and served alongside the MCP and HTTP API endpoints from a single process.

`ddx-server` runs as a per-user host daemon (one instance per machine, see
FEAT-002 and FEAT-020), so the same UI enumerates every project that the
host+user registry knows about and binds its navigation to one selected
project context at a time. The node-aware URL structure and combined
cross-project dashboards are specified in FEAT-021; FEAT-008 owns the
underlying views that those routes render.

The UI consumes GraphQL operations defined in `cli/internal/server/graphql/schema.graphql`.
Every page lists its required query or subscription by name for traceability.

## Problem Statement

**Current situation:** DDx documents, beads, and the doc graph are only accessible via CLI commands or MCP tool calls. There's no visual way to browse the document library, see the dependency graph, check bead status, or review agent activity and execution evidence.

**Pain points:**
- CLI output for `ddx doc graph` is text-only — dependency graphs need visual rendering
- Bead status and dependency trees are hard to grok in terminal output
- DDx agent activity has no browsable interface
- New team members can't quickly understand what documents exist or how they relate

**Desired outcome:** A web dashboard served from the same `ddx-server` binary that already handles MCP and HTTP API. Developers open a browser, see their document library, dependency graph, bead board, and agent activity — all from one URL.

## Architecture

### Single Binary, Multiple Surfaces

```
ddx-server binary
├── /            → Web UI (embedded SvelteKit)
├── /api/        → HTTP REST API (JSON) — frozen
└── /graphql     → GraphQL endpoint (gqlgen)
```

The SvelteKit frontend queries the `/graphql` endpoint for all data. REST endpoints
remain unchanged and are consumed by the CLI and MCP tools only.

### Project Context

The UI is rendered under the node-scoped URL structure defined in FEAT-021:
`/nodes/:nodeId/projects/:projectId/...` for project-scoped views and
`/nodes/:nodeId/...` for combined node-wide dashboards. The root `/`
redirects to `/nodes/:nodeId` using the ID returned by `GET /api/node`
(FEAT-020). When more than one project is registered the navigation bar
exposes a project picker populated from `GET /api/projects`; selecting a
project swaps the `:projectId` segment in place. All GraphQL queries issued by the
UI are bound to the selected project context.

### Build Pipeline

```
cli/internal/server/frontend/   → SvelteKit + TypeScript
  bun run build                 → cli/internal/server/frontend/build/
cli/internal/server/            → Go with embed.FS
  go build                      → ddx-server (single binary with embedded UI)
```

During development, SvelteKit's dev server proxies `/graphql` to the running Go server.

### Technology Choices

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Frontend framework | **Svelte 5** | Compile-time optimizations, no Virtual DOM |
| Build tool | **SvelteKit** | Router, layout, API routes, hooks, adapter-static for embedding |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS** | Consistent with website (Hextra uses Tailwind) |
| Data fetching | **graphql-request + graphql-ws** | Lightweight GraphQL client with typed queries and WebSocket subscriptions |
| Graph visualization | **D3.js** or **Cytoscape.js** | For document dependency graph rendering |
| Embedding | **Go embed.FS** | Compile frontend into the binary — no external files needed |
| Go HTTP | **Chi** or **net/http** | Standard library compatible routing |
| Go GraphQL | **gqlgen** | Schema-first, code-generated resolvers |

### Alternatives Considered

**Templ + htmx** — simpler (no JS toolchain), but the dependency graph visualization and interactive bead board need more interactivity than htmx provides well. Templ + htmx is great for CRUD; we need a richer graph/dashboard experience.

**Local-first with CRDT sync** — interesting for offline use but overkill for v1. The UI is primarily read-heavy (browsing docs, viewing graphs). Can be added later with PowerSync or ElectricSQL if needed.

## Requirements

### Functional

1. **Artifact browser, viewer, and editor**
   - List documents by category (prompts, personas, patterns, templates, ADRs, SDs)
   - Full-text search across document content and frontmatter
   - View document content rendered as markdown with syntax highlighting
   - Show `ddx:` frontmatter metadata (id, dependencies, staleness status)
   - Clickable dependency links — navigate upstream/downstream docs inline
   - **Editor**: in-browser markdown editing with save-to-disk (calls API to write file)
   - Sidebar showing document dependency tree for current doc
   - Staleness indicator per document (fresh/stale/missing-deps)

2. **Document dependency graph**
   - Interactive visual graph (D3/Cytoscape) showing all document relationships
   - Color-code nodes by staleness (green=fresh, orange=stale, red=missing-deps)
   - Click node to navigate to document detail
   - Filter by document type, staleness status
   - Zoom/pan for large graphs
   - Layout options (hierarchical top-down, force-directed)

3. **Bead views**

   The beads UI runs entirely in the browser. On load, the client fetches the
   full bead set from the `beads` query (GraphQL). All search, filter, sort, and graph
   traversal happens client-side using an in-browser data layer.

   **Master-detail list view:**
   - Searchable list: full-text across title, description, acceptance, labels
   - Sortable columns: ID, title, status, priority, labels, owner, updated_at
   - Filterable by status, priority, label, owner
   - Click a bead to open detail panel (split pane or slide-over)
   - Detail shows: all fields, dependency tree, execution beads, agent sessions
   - Graph traversal: click a dependency → navigate to that bead's detail
   - Drill-down into execution runs linked to the bead (shows pass/fail,
     logs, duration)

   **Kanban board view:**
   - Columns represent status: `open`, `in_progress`, `closed`
   - Cards within columns ordered by priority (P0 top, P4 bottom)
   - Dependency grouping: beads that block each other cluster visually
     (similar to Trello, Fuzz by 37signals, GitHub Projects)
   - Drag-and-drop to change status (calls `beadUpdate` mutation)
   - Swimlanes option: group rows by label (e.g., `area:cli`, `area:web`)
   - Color coding: priority → card border, labels → chips, blocked → dimmed
   - Collapsed card shows: title, priority badge, label chips, dep count
   - Expanded card shows: description, acceptance, execution summary

   **Ready queue view:**
   - Filtered view showing only beads with all dependencies satisfied
   - Sorted by priority, then by creation date
   - One-click claim (calls `beadClaim` mutation)
   - Single-ticket ready work is shown ahead of epics; open epics appear in a
     separate epic lane rather than the ordinary execute-loop queue

   **Bead detail actions:**

   The detail panel is not just a viewer — it is the primary interaction
   surface for evaluating and driving work items.

   *Navigation:*
   - `spec-id` links to the governing artifact (rendered inline or navigates
     to the document viewer with that artifact's content)
   - Parent bead link navigates to the parent's detail
   - Dependency links navigate to each dep's detail
   - Execution runs link to the execution detail view (logs, results)
   - Agent session links navigate to the agent log viewer for that session

   *Review and re-evaluation:*
   - "Review" action: side-by-side view of the bead's acceptance criteria
     vs the latest execution results and implementation diff. The user or
     agent evaluates whether the work actually meets the spec.
   - "Re-review" action on closed beads: re-evaluates against current
     artifact state — did the governing spec change since the bead was
     closed? If so, flag as potentially stale.
   - Artifact drift indicator: if the `spec-id` artifact's content hash
     changed since the bead was last updated, show a warning badge.

   *Status and lifecycle:*
   - Re-open a closed bead (status → open) with a reason field
   - Re-run: dispatch `ddx exec run` or `ddx agent run` against the bead's
     linked execution definition (calls server API which delegates to CLI)
   - Claim / unclaim for agent coordination
   - Inline status transitions (open → in_progress → closed)

   *Mutation:*
   - Edit all bead fields inline (title, description, acceptance, labels,
     priority, spec-id)
   - Create new beads with guided form
   - Add/remove dependencies by selecting other beads
   - All mutations call the HTTP API which writes to the JSONL store

4. **Agent log monitor**
   - Live-updating list of agent invocations (newest first)
   - Columns: timestamp, harness, model, tokens, duration, exit code
   - Click to expand: DDx metadata, native session/trace references, and any
     DDx-owned detail available for that invocation
   - Filter by harness, time range, exit code
   - Token usage summary (provider-native or DDx-observed, depending on source)
   - Auto-refresh on configurable interval (or subscription in v2)

5. **Status dashboard**
   - Summary cards: document count by type, bead counts by status, stale document count, recent agent activity
   - Quick links to ready beads, stale documents, recent agent activity
   - Project health indicators (library populated, config valid, beads active)
   - Worker list includes single-ticket workers and epic workers separately,
     showing the active bead/epic, worktree, branch, and current phase.
     The worker list is populated from
     `GET /api/projects/:project/workers` (see FEAT-002). Each worker card
     renders the `current_attempt.phase` field as a color-coded phase badge:

     | Phase | Badge color |
     |-------|------------|
     | `queueing` | gray |
     | `launching` | blue |
     | `running` | green |
     | `post_checks` | yellow |
     | `landing` | purple |
     | `done` | teal |
     | `preserved` | orange |
     | `failed` | red |

   - Clicking a worker card expands to show the `recent_phases` timeline from
     `GET /api/projects/:project/workers/:id`. The expanded view also shows
     elapsed time, harness/model identity, cumulative token counts, and a link
     to the full execution evidence bundle for completed attempts.
   - For in-flight workers, the card auto-refreshes using the `workerProgress`
     subscription. The UI updates the phase badge, elapsed time, and token count from
     each progress event without re-fetching the full worker record. When the terminal
     phase event arrives, the stream closes and the card switches to a static completed state.

6. **Epic execution view**
   - Lists open epics separately from single-ticket ready work
   - Shows epic branch name, epic worktree path, active child bead, and merge
     gate status
   - Shows sequential child-bead history on the epic branch
   - Allows the user to inspect the final epic merge candidate and merge-gate
     results before the merge commit is created

7. **Provider / Harness Dashboard**

   A dedicated page — separate from the status dashboard, agent log monitor,
   and worker progress view — that gives operators a clear picture of
   configured providers and the routing signals DDx uses to make harness
   decisions.

   **Provider list panel (left/top):**
   - One row per configured harness (claude, codex, opencode, gemini, …)
   - Columns: harness name, display name, availability badge (`available` |
     `unavailable` | `unknown`), auth state badge, quota/headroom pill
     (`ok` | `blocked` | `unknown`), cost class, freshness timestamp
   - Searchable by harness name, model, status, or cost class
   - Sortable by any column; default sort by availability, then name
   - Filter chips: availability status, auth state, quota state, signal source
   - All data fetched from `GET /api/providers` on load; auto-refreshes on a
     configurable interval (default 60 s)

   **Provider detail panel (right/bottom, shown on row click):**
   - Full routing signal snapshot for the selected harness
   - Per-model quota/headroom with source attribution and `unknown` when no
     stable live source exists
   - Historical usage table: 7-day and 30-day windows for input/output/total
     tokens and cost; `unknown` rendered as `—` not `0`
   - Burn estimate row: daily token rate, subscription burn class, confidence
     label (`high` / `medium` / `low`), freshness timestamp
   - Performance signals: p50/p95 latency, success rate, sample count, window
   - Signal source provenance list: which sources contributed to this snapshot
     (e.g. `stats-cache`, `native-session-jsonl`, `ddx-metrics`, `none`)
   - Data fetched from `GET /api/providers/:harness` on panel open

   **Unknown-state semantics:**
   - `unknown` values are rendered with an explicit `—` or "unknown" label
     and a tooltip explaining why (e.g., "no stable non-PTY quota source
     confirmed for Claude")
   - Fields from provider-native sources are labeled "provider-reported"
   - Fields derived by DDx from observed metrics are labeled "DDx-estimated"
   - Fields that are genuinely absent carry a `?` badge, not a synthesized `0`

   **Relationship to other views:**
   - Provider dashboard is host+user global (not project-scoped); it is
     accessible from the top-level navigation bar alongside the project picker
   - The status dashboard worker cards link to worker detail and the agent log
     monitor — not to the provider dashboard
   - The agent log monitor session detail links to the provider dashboard for
     the harness used in that invocation (via harness name)
   - The provider dashboard does NOT embed worker progress, bead state, or
     execution history; those live in their own dedicated views

   **Reporting and export:**
   - "Copy JSON" action on the detail panel copies the `GET /api/providers/:harness`
     response verbatim — useful for bug reports and operator audits
   - Time-window selector (7d / 30d / custom) scopes the historical usage table

8. **Persona viewer**
   - Browse personas with descriptions and tags
   - See which roles each persona is bound to in project config
   - View full persona content rendered as markdown

### Non-Functional

- **Performance:** Initial page load <2s. API calls <200ms. Graph renders smoothly for 100+ nodes.
- **Deployment:** Single binary. No external runtime dependencies. No separate frontend server in production.
- **Development:** `bun run dev` proxies to Go server. Hot reload for frontend. `go run` for backend.
- **Responsive:** Usable on tablet/laptop screens. Not optimized for mobile.

**As a** developer investigating a work item
**I want** to search beads and navigate their dependency graph
**So that** I can trace blocking relationships and inspect execution evidence

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I type in the search bar, then results filter instantly (client-side,
  no server round-trip) across title, description, acceptance, and labels
- Given I'm viewing a bead's detail, when I click a dependency link, then I
  navigate to that bead's detail

  duration, and can expand to see logs

### US-082c: Developer Views Bead Execution Evidence
**As a** developer evaluating whether a bead is truly done
**I want** to drill into the execution beads and agent activity associated
  with a work item
**So that** I can verify tests passed and the implementation matches acceptance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a bead has execution runs, when I open its detail, then I see a list
  of runs with status, harness, duration, and timestamp
- Given I click a run, then I see structured results and raw log output

  available native session references

### US-082d: Supervisor Reviews Bead Against Governing Artifact
**As a** supervisor evaluating completed work
**I want** to review a bead's implementation against its governing spec and
  acceptance criteria side-by-side
**So that** I can confirm the work meets the spec or re-open it

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I click "Review" on a closed bead, then I see the bead's acceptance
  criteria alongside the latest execution results and a link to the governing
  artifact's content
- Given the governing artifact changed since the bead was closed, then a
  drift warning badge is shown
- Given I determine the work is insufficient, when I click "Re-open" and
  provide a reason, then the bead status returns to open with the reason
  recorded

### US-082e: Supervisor Re-runs Execution from Bead Detail
**As a** supervisor who wants fresh evidence
**I want** to re-run an execution or agent invocation directly from the bead
  detail
**So that** I can verify the implementation still works after spec changes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a bead has a linked execution definition, when I click "Re-run", then
  the execution is dispatched via the server API
- Given the run completes, then the result appears in the bead's execution
  list and the UI refreshes
- Given I want to run an agent review, when I click "Agent review", then
  an agent session is dispatched with the bead's context as the prompt

### US-082f: Developer Navigates from Bead to Related Artifacts
**As a** developer exploring a work item
**I want** to navigate from a bead to its governing spec, parent bead,
  dependencies, and execution evidence in one click
**So that** I can build a complete picture without switching to the terminal

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a bead has `spec-id: FEAT-001`, when I click the spec link, then I
  navigate to the document viewer showing FEAT-001's content
- Given a bead has a parent, when I click the parent link, then I navigate
  to the parent bead's detail
- Given a bead has execution runs, when I click a run, then I navigate to
  the execution detail view with logs and structured results

### US-083: Developer Edits Document in Browser
**As a** developer fixing a stale document
**I want** to edit its markdown content in the browser and save
**So that** I don't need to switch to my editor for quick fixes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm viewing a document, when I click "Edit", then I see a markdown editor with the current content
- Given I make changes and click "Save", then the file is written to disk via the API
- Given the save succeeds, then the rendered view updates and staleness is rechecked

### US-084: Developer Searches Across All Documents
**As a** developer looking for how something is documented
**I want** to search across all document content
**So that** I can find relevant docs without knowing their location

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I type in the search bar, then results appear from all document types
- Given results are shown, then I see matching snippets with the search term highlighted
- Given I click a result, then I navigate to that document's detail view

### US-085: Developer Creates and Manages Beads in the UI
**As a** developer triaging work
**I want** to create beads, set their status, and manage dependencies in the browser
**So that** I can manage the work queue visually

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I click "New Bead", then I see a form with title, type, priority, labels, description, acceptance
- Given I submit the form, then a bead is created via the API and appears in the list
- Given I click a bead's status, then I can transition it (open → in_progress → closed)
- Given I'm viewing a bead, then I can add/remove dependencies by selecting other beads

### US-085b: Operator Tracks Live Worker Progress from Status Dashboard
**As an** operator supervising a running execute-loop
**I want** to see each worker's current execution phase in real time
**So that** I can tell whether an agent is making progress, stalled, or done
**without** leaving the browser

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a worker is in the `running` phase, when I open the status dashboard,
  then I see a green "running" phase badge on the worker card with the elapsed
  time and current token count
- Given the worker transitions to `post_checks`, then the badge updates to
  yellow "post_checks" within the subscription delivery latency (no manual refresh required)
- Given I click a worker card, then I see the `recent_phases` timeline showing
  when each phase started (timestamp and elapsed since attempt began)
- Given the worker reaches a terminal phase (`done`, `preserved`, or `failed`),
  then the card updates to the terminal badge color and stops live-updating
- Given I look at a worker card, then I can see harness, model, and bead title
  without expanding the card
- Given I expand a worker card for a completed attempt, then I see a link to
  the execution evidence bundle for that attempt

### US-087: Operator Inspects Provider Availability and Routing Signals
**As an** operator about to queue a batch of agent work
**I want** to see configured providers with their availability, auth state,
  and quota/headroom at a glance
**So that** I can choose which harnesses are viable before dispatching

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given providers are configured, when I open the Provider Dashboard, then I
  see one row per harness with availability, auth state, and quota/headroom badges
- Given a provider's quota/headroom has no stable live source, then the badge
  shows "unknown" with a tooltip — not a fabricated `ok` or `blocked` value
- Given I click a row, then the detail panel opens showing the full routing
  signal snapshot with source attribution and freshness timestamp
- Given I click the harness link in the agent log monitor for an invocation,
  then I navigate to that harness's detail in the Provider Dashboard

### US-088: Operator Reviews Provider Utilization and Burn Rate
**As an** operator tracking subscription usage
**I want** to see historical token consumption, burn rate, and confidence level
  for each configured provider
**So that** I can balance load across providers and anticipate quota pressure

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a provider has DDx-observed or provider-native usage history, when I
  view its detail panel, then I see a 7-day and 30-day usage table with
  input/output/total tokens and cost where known
- Given a token or cost field has no trustworthy source, then it renders as `—`
  not `0` or a fabricated value
- Given a burn estimate exists, then the detail panel shows the daily token rate,
  subscription burn class, confidence label, and the timestamp of the last
  contributing signal
- Given I want to share a provider's signal state with a colleague, then I can
  use "Copy JSON" to get the raw API response for the selected harness

### US-088b: Operator Distinguishes Source Types in Provider Detail
**As an** operator debugging a routing decision
**I want** to know whether each signal field came from the provider directly,
  DDx estimation, or is unknown
**So that** I can trust or question the data DDx is routing on

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a field came from a provider-native source (e.g. `stats-cache`), then
  a "provider-reported" label or badge is shown
- Given a field was derived by DDx from observed invocation metrics, then a
  "DDx-estimated" label is shown
- Given no source exists for a field, then a `?` badge appears — no `0` or
  inferred value is displayed
- Given I hover a `?` or "unknown" badge, then a tooltip explains why the
  value is unavailable (e.g., "no stable non-PTY quota source confirmed")

### US-086: Developer Monitors Agent Activity in Real Time
**As a** developer running agents against my project
**I want** to see agent invocations as they happen with routing metadata and
available session references
**So that** I can diagnose issues and track token usage without DDx duplicating
provider logs

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given agents have been invoked, when I open the agent log view, then I see
  recent invocations sorted by time
- Given I click an invocation, then I see DDx runtime metadata plus native
  session or trace references and any available DDx-owned detail
- Given I filter by harness, then only invocations for that harness are shown
- Given I look at the summary, then I see total tokens consumed by harness and
  by day where a signal source exists

### US-081a: Developer Follows Intra-Repo Markdown Links
**As a** developer reading one doc and referenced by another
**I want** markdown links inside the rendered view to navigate to the
  linked doc within the UI
**So that** I can traverse the document graph by following the links the
  author actually wrote, not only the dependency edges

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a rendered doc contains a link like
  `[FEAT-006](../features/FEAT-006-agent-service.md)` or
  `[spec](/docs/helix/02-design/solution-designs/SD-022-gql-svelte-migration.md)`,
  when I click the link, then I navigate to that doc's detail view in the
  SAME tab without a full page reload
- Given I click a link and then hit the browser Back button, then I return
  to the previous doc with its scroll position restored
- Given a link points outside the repo (absolute http[s] URL), when I click
  it, then it opens in a new tab (`target=_blank rel=noopener`) and DOES
  NOT navigate away from the UI
- Given a link points to an anchor on the same doc (`#section-id`), when I
  click it, then the page scrolls to that anchor without changing the route

### US-082g: Developer Sorts and Filters the Beads List
**As a** developer triaging the backlog
**I want** to sort and filter the beads list by common criteria
**So that** I can find what's ready, what's blocked, what's mine, and what
  was most recently updated without scrolling through hundreds of rows

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the beads list is open, then sort controls are present for
  `Priority` (P0 first by default), `Updated`, `Created`, `Title`. Clicking
  a header toggles asc/desc; active sort is visible.
- Given I click a status filter chip (Open / Ready / Blocked / In-progress
  / Closed), then only beads matching that status appear AND the URL
  updates to `?status=<name>` so the filter is bookmarkable
- Given I apply multiple filters (e.g. `?status=open&priority=p0`), then
  all filters compose with AND semantics; the URL reflects every active
  chip
- Given I type in the search box with active filters, then the search
  narrows the already-filtered set (filter scope, not search scope)
- Given I click a label chip on any bead row, then the list filters to
  that label; clicking it again removes the filter
- Given the list is filtered to empty, then a zero-state panel explains
  the filter combination and offers a "clear filters" affordance
- Given I reload a URL with filter + sort params, then the same view is
  restored without interaction

### US-083a: Developer Toggles WYSIWYG vs Plain-Markdown Editor
**As a** developer editing a doc in the browser
**I want** to choose between a rich preview-while-editing view and a
  raw-markdown textarea
**So that** I can fix a typo in the rendered view or hand-edit frontmatter
  without a round-trip

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm editing a doc, then a mode toggle is visible with two options:
  `WYSIWYG` (default) and `Plain`
- Given I'm in `WYSIWYG` mode, when I toggle to `Plain`, then the editor
  switches to a monospace textarea containing the exact raw markdown
  (frontmatter preserved); unsaved edits are retained across the toggle
- Given I'm in `Plain` mode and I toggle back to `WYSIWYG`, then my raw
  edits re-render immediately
- Given the doc has YAML frontmatter, `Plain` mode shows and edits the
  frontmatter; `WYSIWYG` mode shows a collapsible "Frontmatter" panel
  above the content
- Given I save from either mode, then the file is written to disk via
  `documentWrite` with the raw markdown; the render view refreshes; the
  doc's "Updated" timestamp advances

### US-085c: Developer Deletes (Soft-Closes) a Bead from the UI
**As a** developer cleaning up mis-filed beads
**I want** to delete a bead from the UI
**So that** mistakes don't pollute the queue

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am on a bead's detail panel, then a `Delete` button is visible
  with destructive styling (icon + danger palette token; not red alone)
- Given I click `Delete`, then a confirmation modal opens showing the
  bead ID, title, and a required text field where I type the bead ID to
  confirm (prevents accidental deletes)
- Given I confirm, then the bead is soft-closed via the standard close
  path (status → `closed`, reason recorded as `deleted via UI`); the
  list refreshes; the detail panel closes; the URL redirects to the
  beads list
- Given I cancel the modal, then the bead is unchanged and the modal
  closes; focus returns to the Delete button
- Given a bead has active child beads (parent of N open beads), then
  the confirmation modal surfaces the child count and requires
  additional `--cascade` checkbox opt-in; canceled by default

### US-086a: Developer Sees Streaming Agent Response Text
**As a** developer watching an agent work on a bead
**I want** to see the agent's response content stream in as it's produced
**So that** I can tell what the agent is doing without tailing log files

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a worker is in a running phase for a bead, when I open the worker
  detail, then a "Live response" panel shows accumulated response text,
  updating as the `workerProgress` subscription delivers `text_delta`
  frames
- Given the response contains tool calls, then each tool call is rendered
  as a collapsible card showing the tool name, inputs, and (once returned)
  the output, interleaved with text in delivery order
- Given the worker reaches a terminal phase, then the live-response panel
  freezes at its final content with a "Completed at HH:MM:SS" timestamp
  and a link to the execution evidence bundle
- Given the subscription disconnects mid-stream, then a banner shows
  "Reconnecting…" and the panel auto-resumes on reconnect without losing
  the text received so far

### US-095: Operator Initiates Work from the UI
**As an** operator managing a project without context-switching to a
  terminal
**I want** to start common work flows from the UI
**So that** "drain the queue", "re-align the specs", and "run the tests"
  are one click away

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am on a project view, then an `Actions` panel exposes at
  minimum three actions:
  - `Drain queue` — dispatches `ddx work` as a server-side worker
  - `Re-align specs` — dispatches a HELIX `align` action as a worker
  - `Run checks` — dispatches the project's execution definitions
- Given I click an action, then a confirmation dialog shows the expected
  scope (e.g. "N ready beads will be attempted"); on confirm, the worker
  is dispatched and appears in the Workers list within 1s
- Given dispatching fails (e.g. queue already has an active worker of
  the same kind), then the dialog surfaces the error with a clear
  remediation hint; no silent failure
- Given I start an action, then the originating button shows a spinner
  until the worker is `running`; the button becomes an anchor to that
  worker's detail
- Given I lack permission or a prerequisite is missing (no ready beads,
  no spec tree, no check suite), then the action is disabled with a
  tooltip explaining the prerequisite

### US-096: Operator Views Model Efficacy and Runs Comparisons
**As an** operator pursuing the cost-tiered throughput-per-dollar goal
**I want** to see per-model completion rates, cost, and latency, and run
  A/B comparisons between prompts or models
**So that** I can steer the system toward the models and prompts that
  actually work

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given closed beads carry `kind:cost` + `kind:routing` evidence events,
  when I open the `Efficacy` view, then a table lists every distinct
  `(harness, provider, model)` tuple used in the last N days with:
  success count, attempt count, completion rate, median tokens in/out,
  median duration, median cost (or `—` when no cost signal)
- Given I filter by tier / label / spec-id, then the table refilters
  live; URL encodes the filter for bookmarking
- Given I click `Compare`, then a dialog lets me pick N `(model, prompt)`
  pairs; on submit, DDx dispatches `ddx agent compare` and the resulting
  `ComparisonRecord` appears under `Comparisons` with per-arm outputs,
  diffs, and (if configured) grader scores
- Given a model's completion rate crosses the configured adaptive-min-tier
  floor (trailing-window success rate < threshold), then a warning badge
  appears on that row with a tooltip linking to the routing metrics doc
- Given I click a row, then a detail panel shows the last 10 attempts
  with per-attempt outcome, evidence links, and links to the execution
  bundles; click-through to the bead that originated each attempt

### US-097: Developer Browses and Binds Personas
**As a** developer configuring a project for consistent agent behavior
**I want** to browse available personas in the UI and bind them to roles
**So that** I don't have to hand-edit `.ddx/config.yaml`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given personas are installed (via `ddx install` or the DDx default
  plugin), when I open the `Personas` page, then I see a card per persona
  with name, role tags, and a short description pulled from the
  persona file's frontmatter
- Given a persona's card, when I click it, then I see the full persona
  body rendered as markdown plus the list of projects currently binding
  this persona and the role each binds
- Given I am on a persona detail and I click `Bind to role`, then a form
  lets me pick a role (code-reviewer, test-engineer, implementer, etc.)
  and project; submitting writes the binding to `.ddx/config.yaml`'s
  `persona_bindings` map via a server-side mutation
- Given a role is already bound in the selected project, then the form
  warns "This will replace the existing binding: `X`" and requires
  confirmation before overwriting

### US-098: Operator Browses and Installs Plugins
**As an** operator setting up DDx for a new project
**I want** to see available plugins and install one from the UI
**So that** I don't have to know the exact `ddx install <name>` invocation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the `Plugins` page is open, then I see all plugins from the
  built-in registry plus any configured additional registries, with
  name, version, type (workflow / plugin / persona-pack / template-pack),
  description, keywords, and install status (installed / available /
  update-available)
- Given I click an available plugin, when I click `Install`, then a
  modal shows the install scope (global vs project) and required disk
  space; on confirm, the UI triggers `ddx install <name>` server-side
  and streams install progress via a worker-backed dispatch
- Given a plugin is installed, then I can view its manifest
  (package.yaml), its skills, its prompts, and its templates from the
  same card; an `Uninstall` action with confirmation is present
- Given a plugin has an available update, then the card shows both
  current and target versions and an `Update` action

### US-099: Developer Uses a Keyboard Command Palette
**As a** developer who lives on the keyboard
**I want** a command palette (Cmd+K / Ctrl+K) for navigation and actions
**So that** I can jump to any bead, document, or action without using the
  mouse

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I press `Cmd+K` (or `Ctrl+K` on non-mac), then a modal search
  palette opens with focus in the input field
- Given I type in the palette, then results include: documents (matching
  path or title), beads (matching id or title), actions from US-095,
  and navigation entries (every top-level page)
- Given I press `Enter` on a result, then I navigate to that destination
  (or trigger that action); the palette closes
- Given I press `Escape`, then the palette closes without changes
- Given I press `Cmd+K` while on a bead detail, then bead-specific actions
  (Claim, Unclaim, Close, Reopen, Re-run, Delete) appear at the top of
  the result list with their keybindings
- Given I'm on a deep URL and open the palette, then navigation results
  preserve the current project/node context (relative paths, not
  absolute)

## Provider Dashboard: Playwright Fixture Scenarios

The provider dashboard has deterministic fixture data requirements so that
Playwright tests can cover all meaningful display states without live provider
credentials. The fixture layer is a static JSON handler mounted at
`/api/providers` and `/api/providers/:harness` during test runs. Each scenario
below defines the fixture variant and the expected rendered state.

### Fixture Scenarios

**Scenario 1 — all-healthy (green path)**

Provider list returns two harnesses, both `available` + `authenticated` +
`quota_headroom: ok`. Detail panel shows populated 7d/30d usage, burn estimate
with `confidence: high`, and `signal_sources: ["native-session-jsonl", "ddx-metrics"]`.
Expected: all badges green, no `?` badges, no unknown labels.

```json
[
  {
    "harness": "codex", "status": "available", "auth_state": "authenticated",
    "quota_headroom": "ok", "cost_class": "subscription",
    "signal_sources": ["native-session-jsonl", "ddx-metrics"],
    "freshness_ts": "2026-04-14T05:00:00Z",
    "recent_success_rate": 0.99, "recent_latency_p50_ms": 3100
  },
  {
    "harness": "claude", "status": "available", "auth_state": "authenticated",
    "quota_headroom": "ok", "cost_class": "subscription",
    "signal_sources": ["stats-cache", "ddx-metrics"],
    "freshness_ts": "2026-04-14T05:00:00Z",
    "recent_success_rate": 0.97, "recent_latency_p50_ms": 4200
  }
]
```

**Scenario 2 — quota unknown (common real-world state for Claude)**

Claude harness has `quota_headroom: unknown` because no stable non-PTY quota
source exists. Codex is `quota_headroom: ok`. Expected: Claude row shows an
"unknown" pill with tooltip "no stable non-PTY quota source confirmed". All
other state fields are populated.

**Scenario 3 — provider unavailable**

One harness has `status: unavailable` and `auth_state: unauthenticated`.
Expected: row shows red "unavailable" badge and gray "unauthenticated" badge.
Detail panel shows empty usage tables with `—` cells and a signal source list
of `["none"]`.

**Scenario 4 — stale signals / low-confidence burn**

Provider is available and authenticated, but `freshness_ts` is 48 hours ago
and `burn_estimate.confidence` is `low`. Expected: freshness timestamp renders
with a "stale" indicator; burn estimate row shows `confidence: low` label.

**Scenario 5 — all unknown (offline / fresh install)**

Provider list returns one harness with `status: unknown`, `auth_state: unknown`,
`quota_headroom: unknown`, `signal_sources: ["none"]`. Expected: every badge
shows "unknown" or `—`; no zeros appear in usage tables; tooltip text explains
each unknown field.

**Scenario 6 — search and filter**

Provider list returns five harnesses with mixed statuses. Test: entering a
search term filters the list in real time (client-side); selecting a filter
chip for `status: available` hides unavailable rows; clearing chips restores
the full list.

### Fixture File Layout

```
cli/internal/server/frontend/
└── src/
    └── testing/
        └── fixtures/
            └── providers/
                ├── all-healthy.json
                ├── quota-unknown.json
                ├── provider-unavailable.json
                ├── stale-signals.json
                └── all-unknown.json
```

Playwright tests mount the appropriate fixture via request interceptors before
each scenario. The fixture format matches the `/api/providers` and
`/api/providers/:harness` response shapes defined in FEAT-002.

## Implementation Notes

### Embedding Pattern (Pocketbase-style)

```go
//go:embed all:frontend/build
var frontendFiles embed.FS

func main() {
    distFS, _ := fs.Sub(frontendFiles, "frontend/build") // relative to embed.go in cli/internal/server/
    
    mux := http.NewServeMux()
    mux.Handle("/api/", apiRouter)
    mux.Handle("/mcp/", mcpHandler)
    mux.Handle("/", spaHandler(http.FS(distFS))) // SPA fallback
}

// spaHandler serves static files, falling back to index.html for SPA routing
func spaHandler(fs http.FileSystem) http.Handler {
    fileServer := http.FileServer(fs)
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        if _, err := fs.Open(r.URL.Path); err != nil {
            r.URL.Path = "/"
        }
        fileServer.ServeHTTP(w, r)
    })
}
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Terminal 1: Go server
cd cli/internal/server && go run . --library-path ../../../.ddx/library

# Terminal 2: SvelteKit dev server with proxy
cd cli/internal/server/frontend && bun run dev
# svelte.config.js proxies /graphql and /api to localhost:8080
```

## Dependencies

- FEAT-002 (DDx server HTTP/MCP API) — the web UI consumes GraphQL at `/graphql`;
  REST endpoints stay frozen for CLI/MCP compatibility
- FEAT-004 (Beads) — for bead board; queries `beads` and mutations `beadCreate`, `beadUpdate`, `beadClaim`
- FEAT-007 (Doc graph) — for dependency graph visualization; queries `docGraph`
- FEAT-006 (Agent service) — for agent activity and invocation detail
- FEAT-014 (Agent Usage Awareness and Routing Signals) — governs the routing
  signal model consumed by the provider dashboard
- FEAT-021 (Dashboard UI) — defines URL scheme and navigation patterns
- SvelteKit, Svelte 5, Bun, graphql-request, graphql-ws, bits-ui, lucide-svelte, Tailwind
- Playwright for testing (no MSW)
- Go embed.FS, Chi or net/http, gqlgen

## Out of Scope

- Real-time sync / collaborative editing
- Mobile-optimized layout
- Authentication (localhost-only for v1; auth deferred to FEAT-002 server security)
- Server-side search or pagination for beads (client-side only — GraphQL cursors in v2)

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests

- Component tests for beads list, filter chips, detail panel
- Page-level tests for documents viewer, graph page, worker detail
- Store tests for node context, project selection, dark mode

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

All tests run against the built SvelteKit app served by `ddx-server`.

- **navigation.spec.ts** — `/` redirect to `/nodes/:nodeId`, project picker
- **beads.spec.ts** — list, filter, search, detail, claim/unclaim, mutations
- **documents.spec.ts** — list, markdown render, edit-in-place, search
- **graph.spec.ts** — graph visualization, drag/zoom, tooltip interaction
- **workers.spec.ts** — worker list, live log via subscription, phase tracking
- **providers.spec.ts** — provider dashboard, filter, detail panel, copy JSON

Each test maps to a specific user story and acceptance criteria.
