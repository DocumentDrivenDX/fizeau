# Feature: Agent Usage Awareness and Routing Signals

**ID:** FEAT-014
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** P1
**Owner:** DDx Team

## Overview

DDx's agent wrapper should understand provider-native usage and routing signals
across harnesses so that every `ddx agent run` can make an informed decision
about which harness to use based on request fit, availability, cost,
performance, and current quota/headroom when known.

## Problem Statement

**Current situation:**
- DDx can extract per-invocation token and cost data from subprocess output for
  codex, claude, and opencode.
- DDx currently aggregates usage through its own session-log model, but that
  duplicates external provider storage and suppresses native persistence for
  codex and claude by default.
- Codex native session JSONL already carries `token_count` and `rate_limits`
  data when persistence is enabled, which is more useful for routing than DDx's
  current duplicate session ledger.
- Claude exposes historical usage via `~/.claude/stats-cache.json`, but the
  best current-quota source is still unresolved. DDx should exhaust stable
  non-PTY options before accepting PTY automation.
- The embedded `ddx-agent` runtime is gaining its own session logging and OTEL
  telemetry. DDx should consume that telemetry minimally rather than re-owning
  the runtime's logs.
- DDx does not yet have a normalized routing-signal model that combines
  capability, availability, quota/headroom, cost, and DDx-observed performance
  into one preflight harness decision.

**Desired outcome:** Every `ddx agent run` evaluates candidate harnesses using
normalized routing signals:
- request fit (profile/model/effort/permissions)
- provider availability and authentication
- current quota/headroom where known
- cost estimate or cost class
- DDx-observed performance and reliability

External harnesses preserve native persistence. DDx owns only the minimal
activity and performance metadata needed for routing and provenance.

## Spike Findings

### Per-Invocation Data (implemented)

| Harness | Token Data | Cost Data | Status |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| codex | `turn.completed` JSONL: `input_tokens`, `cached_input_tokens`, `output_tokens` | Not reported | Working |
| claude | JSON envelope: `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_read/creation_input_tokens` | `total_cost_usd` | Working |
| opencode | JSON envelope: `input_tokens`, `output_tokens` (if present) | `total_cost_usd` (if present) | Working |
| gemini | Untested; no live auth available | Unknown | Blocked |

### Signal-Source Matrix (re-reviewed)

| Source family | Current quota/headroom | Historical usage | Freshness | Scope | Stable enough for preflight routing? | Notes |
|--------------|------------------------|------------------|-----------|-------|-------------------------------------|-------|
| Codex native session JSONL / local state | Yes, when persistence is enabled and `token_count.rate_limits` is present | Yes, recent usage totals from session JSONL and local state | Near-real-time once Codex writes the session log; stale if the file is missing or unreadable | Machine-local, authenticated Codex session/account state | Yes, preferred live source for Codex routing when readable | Treat missing persistence or unreadable logs as `unknown`; do not rely on inline PTY scraping in the routing path |
| Claude `~/.claude/stats-cache.json` | No stable non-PTY source confirmed yet; surface as `unknown` | Yes, account-wide daily activity, daily tokens by model, cumulative model usage, session counts, and hour-of-day distribution | Cached and delayed; freshness depends on the last stats-cache write | Machine-local cache with account-wide historical usage | Yes for historical usage, no for current quota | Use this source for history and load balancing only; current quota remains `unknown` until a stable live source is confirmed |
| Claude runtime / statusline / SDK / hook artifacts | None confirmed | None confirmed | N/A unless a trustworthy source is discovered | N/A until validated | No, not yet | Investigate these before any PTY fallback; if live probing becomes necessary, feed an async snapshot cache rather than routing-time terminal scraping |
| embedded `ddx-agent` telemetry | Not a provider quota source | Yes, DDx-owned invocation activity, runtime metrics, and session references | Per invocation or per write | Local workspace / install / session | Yes for DDx-observed performance and provenance; no for provider quota routing | Consume references and derived metrics only; do not duplicate provider transcript storage or provider quota state |

Interpretation:

- `unknown` means no trustworthy live source exists, the source is stale, or the data is unreadable.
- Unknown quota/headroom stays viable for routing with reduced confidence; it is not fabricated into `ok` or `blocked`.
- If a current quota source requires active probing, the probe must populate an async snapshot history and never block routing on synchronous PTY scraping.

### Research Priorities

1. **Codex adapter from native logs** — use native session JSONL as the first
   source of truth for current headroom and recent totals.
2. **Claude non-PTY quota research** — investigate statusline, SDK, hook, or
   other local runtime sources before accepting any PTY-based solution.
3. **Minimal DDx-owned routing metrics** — define the smallest DDx state needed
   to compare performance and reliability across harnesses without duplicating
   provider transcripts.
4. **Snapshot history and subscription-cost proxy** — when a current quota
   source requires active probing, DDx should checkpoint quota snapshots over
   time, map them to native usage accumulation, and estimate subscription burn
   pressure well enough to balance providers intelligently.

## Requirements

### Functional

**Per-invocation extraction (complete)**
1. codex harness: `--json` flag, `turn.completed` JSONL parsing
2. claude harness: `--output-format=json`, JSON envelope parsing with
   `total_cost_usd`
3. opencode harness: `run --format json`, JSON envelope parsing
4. `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cost_usd` fields on DDx invocation
   activity rows
5. `ddx agent usage` command with harness/time-window/machine-readable output
6. gemini harness: investigate `--output-format=json` output when auth is
   available; implement token extraction if format is known

**Provider-native signal ingestion**
7. **Native persistence preserved** — DDx must not pass suppressive flags such
   as codex `--ephemeral` or claude `--no-session-persistence` by default for
   external harnesses.
8. **Codex native signal adapter** — read current quota/headroom and recent
   usage from native Codex session JSONL when persistence is enabled.
9. **Claude historical usage adapter** — read `~/.claude/stats-cache.json` to
   obtain account-wide daily token consumption by model, session counts, and
   activity patterns.
10. **Claude current quota spike** — identify a stable non-PTY current-quota
    source if one exists. If no stable source is found, DDx must surface quota
    as `unknown` rather than inventing it. PTY automation is explicitly a
    fallback of last resort, not the MVP path, and must feed an asynchronous
    snapshot/sampling path rather than synchronous routing-time scraping.
11. **Signal freshness/cache policy** — cache provider-native signal reads with
    explicit freshness semantics so `ddx agent run` can distinguish fresh from
    stale state.

**Normalized routing signals**
12. **Routing signal model** — DDx normalizes every candidate's:
    - capability/request fit
    - availability/authentication state
    - quota/headroom state (`ok`, `blocked`, `unknown`)
    - cost estimate or cost class
    - DDx-observed performance metrics
    - freshness / confidence
13. **Minimal DDx-owned metrics** — DDx stores only compact outcome samples,
    async quota snapshots, and derived burn summaries. Those records are
    attributed to the resolved canonical target or exact model pin so
    different models on the same surface do not share one routing signal.
    Outcome samples may record recent success/failure, latency, and last
    observed token/cost values when available; DDx does not store provider
    transcripts or native session bodies as routing inputs.
14. **Snapshot history for live quota sources** — when DDx depends on an
    actively probed quota source, it checkpoints time-stamped quota snapshots
    asynchronously and relates them to native usage accumulation to build a
    history of usage plus quota availability.
15. **Subscription-cost proxy** — DDx derives a relative subscription burn
    estimate from quota snapshots and usage deltas well enough to balance
    providers under subscription plans where direct per-token billing is
    unavailable.
16. **Routing integration** — harness selection uses the normalized signal
    model together with requested profile, model, effort, permission mode, and
    explicit harness override semantics.
17. **Operator visibility** — `ddx agent doctor --routing` and `ddx agent
    usage` consume the normalized signal model and report source freshness.

**Budgeting and throttling**
18. **Deferred scope** — budget passthrough, automatic throttling, and pacing
    policy remain follow-on work after the signal-source spikes establish the
    right acquisition model.

**Always-on execute-bead runtime metrics**
19. `ddx agent execute-bead` must capture built-in runtime metrics for every
    iteration, independent of any graph-authored execution documents. These are
    DDx runtime facts, not substitutes for project-authored metric docs. The
    fields below are persisted into the project's
    `.ddx/executions/<attempt-id>/` attempt bundle (FEAT-006) so the host+user
    `ddx-server` and its dashboards can replay runtime metrics from the same
    replay-backed artifacts that back execution history — DDx does not keep a
    separate runtime-metrics store. When execute-bead runs inside the server's
    supervised `WorkerManager` (FEAT-002), the worker writes the same bundle to
    the project that owns the bead.
    Minimum fields (where available):
    - `harness`, `model`, `session_id`
    - `elapsed_ms`
    - `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `total_tokens`
    - `cost_usd` (`-1` when unknown, `0` for local models)
    - `base_rev`
    - `result_rev`
20. **Tracked metrics surface.** The runtime metrics captured in requirement
    19 are persisted in the tracked execute-bead attempt bundle at
    `.ddx/executions/<attempt-id>/result.json` per FEAT-006 §"Execute-Bead
    Evidence Bundle". The runtime `harness`, `model`, and `session_id`
    values must also be projected into the canonical Git trailer set on
    the iteration commit (`Ddx-Harness`, `Ddx-Model`, and `Ddx-Worker-Id`
    when no distinct worker identity is available) per FEAT-006
    §"Canonical Git trailers". The commit trailers and the JSON block in
    FEAT-006 §"Iteration commit summary" must both be projected from
    `result.json`, never from ad hoc runtime state.

### Non-Functional

- **Performance:** provider-native signal reads and DDx metrics lookups should
  add only modest preflight overhead. Dispatch-time routing should remain fast
  enough to avoid noticeable startup delay.
- **Accuracy:** Token counts from harness JSON output are authoritative.
  Provider-native stores reflect the provider's own accounting and should be
  preferred where available.
- **Zero fabrication:** DDx must never fabricate current quota/headroom. When a
  source is unavailable or stale, DDx surfaces `unknown`.
- **Graceful degradation:** If provider-native stores are missing, unreadable,
  or in an unexpected format, DDx falls back to request fit, static cost, and
  DDx-observed performance metrics. Never fail an invocation solely because a
  signal source could not be read.
- **Minimal ownership:** DDx owns only the metadata needed for routing,
  provenance, and operator visibility. It must not become a shadow transcript
  store for external providers.

## Dashboard Read Model

The normalized routing signal model (requirement 12) doubles as the read model
consumed by the FEAT-008 provider dashboard and the FEAT-002 `/api/providers`
endpoints. FEAT-014 governs field semantics, unknown-state rules, and freshness
conventions for both the routing code path and the UI read path.

### Read-Model Fields

The provider summary and provider detail shapes are defined in FEAT-002
§"Provider Availability and Utilization". FEAT-014 owns the rules that govern
every field:

**Availability and auth fields**

| Field | Type | Source | Unknown condition |
|-------|------|--------|-------------------|
| `status` | `available` \| `unavailable` \| `unknown` | harness discovery | harness cannot be found or tested |
| `auth_state` | `authenticated` \| `unauthenticated` \| `unknown` | per-harness auth probe | probe fails or is not implemented |
| `quota_headroom` | `ok` \| `blocked` \| `unknown` | provider-native or `unknown` | no trustworthy live source exists |

**Utilization fields**

| Field | Type | Source | Unknown sentinel |
|-------|------|--------|-----------------|
| `historical_usage.*.input_tokens` | integer | provider-native or DDx-observed | `-1` (JSON) → rendered as `—` in UI |
| `historical_usage.*.output_tokens` | integer | provider-native or DDx-observed | `-1` |
| `historical_usage.*.cost_usd` | float | provider-native | `-1` |
| `burn_estimate.daily_token_rate` | float | DDx-derived from usage deltas | `-1` |
| `burn_estimate.subscription_burn` | `low` \| `moderate` \| `high` \| `unknown` | DDx-derived | `unknown` when no rate history |
| `burn_estimate.confidence` | `high` \| `medium` \| `low` | DDx-derived | reflects staleness of contributing signal |
| `routing_signals.performance.success_rate` | float 0–1 | DDx-observed | `-1` when sample_count < 3 |

**Freshness fields**

- `freshness_ts` — RFC 3339 timestamp of the oldest contributing signal write.
  When no signals exist the field is omitted (not zero-time).
- `last_checked_ts` — when DDx most recently attempted to read signals for this
  harness. May differ from `freshness_ts` when the read attempt found no new data.
- `signal_sources` — ordered list of source identifiers that contributed to
  this snapshot. Defined values: `native-session-jsonl`, `stats-cache`,
  `ddx-metrics`, `none`. `none` appears alone when no source contributed.

### Source Attribution Labels (for UI display)

The UI renders per-field source labels to distinguish certainty levels:

| `signal_sources` entry | UI label |
|------------------------|----------|
| `native-session-jsonl` | provider-reported |
| `stats-cache` | provider-reported |
| `ddx-metrics` | DDx-estimated |
| `none` | unknown |

When multiple sources contribute, the field-level label reflects the most
authoritative source. Fields absent from all sources carry a `?` badge in the UI
and a tooltip drawn from `source_note` in the per-model quota object.

### Unknown-State Contract

**Zero fabrication.** No field may be coerced from `unknown` / `-1` to `ok` / `0`
for display convenience. UI components must treat `-1` as `unknown` and render
`—`, never `0`. Badge components must treat the string literal `"unknown"` as a
distinct state with its own visual treatment, never as a fallback for `"ok"`.

**Tooltips.** Every `?` badge and every "unknown" pill in the provider dashboard
must include a tooltip populated from one of the defined tooltip strings below:

| Condition | Tooltip text |
|-----------|-------------|
| Claude quota unknown | "No stable non-PTY quota source confirmed for Claude. DDx will route with reduced confidence rather than reject." |
| Signal source not readable | "The signal source could not be read at the last check. DDx is using cached state." |
| No signal history | "No signal history available. DDx will route based on request fit only." |
| Stale signal | "Last signal observed more than 1 hour ago. Data may not reflect current provider state." |

**Routing behavior.** `quota_headroom: unknown` does not block routing. It
reduces routing confidence. `quota_headroom: blocked` rejects the candidate. The
dashboard must not imply that `unknown` means `blocked`.

### Queryable Read Model

The read model supports the following query dimensions for the `/api/providers`
list endpoint and for client-side filtering in the provider dashboard:

| Dimension | Filter values |
|-----------|--------------|
| Provider / harness | exact match on `harness` name |
| Model | substring or exact match on model identifier |
| Status | `available`, `unavailable`, `unknown` |
| Auth state | `authenticated`, `unauthenticated`, `unknown` |
| Quota state | `ok`, `blocked`, `unknown` |
| Signal source | presence of a named source in `signal_sources` |
| Time window | scopes `historical_usage` window (7d, 30d) |

Sorting is supported on: `harness` (alpha), `status`, `auth_state`,
`quota_headroom`, `recent_success_rate`, `recent_latency_p50_ms`,
`freshness_ts`. Default sort: `status` ascending, then `harness` ascending.

## CLI Interface

```bash
# Routing state with freshness and quota/headroom where known
ddx agent doctor --routing

# Usage summary derived from provider-native sources + DDx-owned metrics
ddx agent usage

# Filter to one harness
ddx agent usage --harness claude

# Specific time window
ddx agent usage --since 7d
ddx agent usage --since 2026-04-01

# Machine-readable
ddx agent usage --format json
```

## User Stories

### US-140: Developer Checks Agent Usage and Routing Signals
**As a** developer managing agent usage
**I want** to see provider-native usage signals and DDx-observed routing metrics
**So that** I can understand what DDx is routing on

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I run `ddx agent usage`, then I see per-harness usage/cost where
  available, plus DDx-observed runtime metrics
- Given I run `ddx agent usage --since today`, then only today's windows are
  counted
- Given I run `ddx agent usage --format json`, then output is valid JSON

### US-141: DDx Routes Using Current Availability Signals
**As** the DDx agent router
**I want** to combine request fit, availability, quota/headroom, cost, and
performance signals
**So that** I choose the best viable harness for each run

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given Codex native session logs are available, when DDx evaluates codex, then
  current quota/headroom comes from those native logs rather than PTY
  automation
- Given Claude has no stable current-quota source yet, when DDx evaluates
  claude, then current quota is surfaced as `unknown` rather than fabricated
- Given quota is explicitly blocked for a candidate, then that candidate is
  rejected
- Given quota is unknown for a candidate, then the candidate remains viable but
  is ranked with reduced confidence rather than hard-rejected

### US-142: Developer Sees Signal Freshness in Doctor Output
**As a** developer debugging harness selection
**I want** `ddx agent doctor --routing` to show where each signal came from and
how fresh it is
**So that** I can trust or question DDx's decision with evidence

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I run `ddx agent doctor --routing`, then each harness reports current
  availability state, quota/headroom state, and last-checked freshness
- Given a signal came from a provider-native source, then doctor output
  identifies that source
- Given a signal source could not be read, then doctor output reports `unknown`
  with an explanatory note instead of omitting the field

### US-143: Operator Views Provider Dashboard in Browser
**As an** operator deciding which harnesses to use for a batch of work
**I want** to see all configured providers with routing availability, auth state,
  quota/headroom, utilization, and burn rate in one browser view
**So that** I can make informed dispatch decisions without running CLI commands

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I open the Provider Dashboard (FEAT-008 §"Provider / Harness Dashboard"),
  then I see one row per configured harness with status, auth, quota/headroom,
  cost class, and freshness timestamp
- Given a harness has `quota_headroom: unknown`, then the pill renders "unknown"
  with a tooltip from the FEAT-014 tooltip registry — not a green "ok" badge
- Given I click a row, then the detail panel shows the full read-model fields
  defined in FEAT-014 §"Read-Model Fields", with source labels distinguishing
  provider-reported from DDx-estimated values
- Given a numeric field has no trustworthy source (sentinel `-1`), then the UI
  renders `—`, not `0`
- Given I look at the burn estimate row, then I see `confidence` labeled as
  `high`, `medium`, or `low` — not omitted
- Given I search or filter the provider list, then results update client-side
  within 100 ms without a server round-trip

### US-144: Operator Distinguishes Provider-Reported vs DDx-Estimated Signals
**As an** operator auditing routing signal provenance
**I want** each signal field in the provider dashboard to be labeled by its source
**So that** I can determine how much weight to place on the value

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a field came from `native-session-jsonl` or `stats-cache`, then it
  carries a "provider-reported" label
- Given a field was derived from DDx-observed invocation metrics, then it carries
  a "DDx-estimated" label
- Given the `signal_sources` list includes `none`, then the harness shows no
  usage or burn data, only availability and auth state where detectable

### US-145: Execute-bead Runtime Metrics Are Captured Automatically
**As** a developer reviewing bead execution history
**I want** runtime metrics recorded for every execute-bead iteration without
manual instrumentation
**So that** iterations are comparable and cost is always visible

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given `ddx agent execute-bead` runs with a harness that exposes token and cost
  data, when the iteration completes, then the run record contains `harness`,
  `model`, `session_id`, `elapsed_ms`, `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`,
  `total_tokens`, and `cost_usd`
- Given runtime token and cost data is captured, when the iteration commit
  summary is written, then the summary includes harness, model, total tokens,
  cost, base revision, and result revision

## Dependencies

- FEAT-006 (Agent Service) — harness registry, invocation activity capture
- FEAT-002 (DDx Server) — `/api/providers` and `/api/providers/:harness`
  expose FEAT-014's routing signal model to UI and MCP consumers
- FEAT-008 (Web UI) — the provider dashboard view is the browser surface for
  FEAT-014's read model; FEAT-014 governs field semantics, unknown-state
  rules, and tooltip registry for that view
- provider-native local stores such as `~/.codex/` and `~/.claude/`
- embedded `ddx-agent` runtime telemetry and session references

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 — Signal-source spikes
- Inventory provider-native signal sources and freshness semantics
- Define the minimal routing metrics schema and retention rules
  (now part of ddx-agent's internal routing per CONTRACT-003-ddx-agent-service)
- Resolve whether Claude has a stable non-PTY current-quota source

### Phase 2 — Preserve native persistence and add adapters
- Remove DDx defaults that suppress codex/claude native persistence
- Implement Codex native signal adapter
- Implement Claude historical usage adapter

### Phase 3 — Normalize routing signals
- Build the shared routing signal model
- Feed doctor/usage/routing from that model
- Treat unknown quota as unknown, not as blocked or OK
- If a live quota source requires active probing, persist async snapshot history
  rather than blocking routing on synchronous PTY gymnastics

### Phase 4 — Follow-on policy work
- Budget passthrough
- Throttling / pacing
- Optional PTY fallback only if non-PTY Claude quota sourcing proves impossible

## Out of Scope

- Provider billing API integration
- Intercepting harness HTTP traffic for real-time rate-limit headers
- Gemini token capture (blocked on auth investigation)
- Cross-machine usage aggregation (see FEAT-013)
- Immediate budget enforcement and adaptive throttling policy
- Prompt design and task strategy beyond harness selection
