# Test Plan: DDx Server and Web UI

**ID:** TP-002
**Features:** FEAT-002 (Server), FEAT-008 (Web UI), FEAT-020 (Node State),
FEAT-021 (Dashboard UI), SD-019 (Host+User Multi-Project Topology)

> **Historical** — describes the pre-2026-04-14 React stack. Current stack: see ADR-002 v2.
**Status:** Active

## Scope

End-to-end testing of the DDx server HTTP API, MCP tools, and embedded web
UI. Tests run against a live `ddx server` instance — a per-user host daemon
holding its state at `~/.local/share/ddx/server-state.json` — with real
project data (documents, beads, personas, execution definitions) from one or
more project roots. Coverage includes host+user isolation across registered
projects, concurrent project access, and execute-loop worker lifecycle
supervised by the in-process `WorkerManager`.

## Test Infrastructure

| Component | Tool | Location |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Go unit tests | `go test` | `cli/internal/server/server_test.go` |
| E2E functional tests | Playwright | `cli/internal/server/frontend/e2e/app.spec.ts` |
| Visual regression | Playwright screenshots | `cli/internal/server/frontend/e2e/screenshots.spec.ts` |
| Demo recording | Playwright video | `cli/internal/server/frontend/e2e/demo-recording.spec.ts` |
| Multi-project coverage | Playwright | `cli/internal/server/frontend/e2e/projects.spec.ts` |
| Config (functional) | Playwright | `cli/internal/server/frontend/playwright.config.ts` |
| Config (demo) | Playwright | `cli/internal/server/frontend/playwright.demo.config.ts` |

### Running

```bash
cd cli/internal/server/frontend

# Install browsers (first time)
bunx playwright install chromium

# Functional e2e tests
bun run test:e2e

# Demo video recording
bun run demo:record
# Output: demo-output/
```

The Playwright configs auto-start `ddx server --port 18080` via `webServer`.
Multi-project fixtures point the server at an isolated `XDG_DATA_HOME` so
the host+user state file at `~/.local/share/ddx/server-state.json` is
scoped to the test run, and either seed `server.projects` in config or drive
`POST /api/projects/register` to populate the registry with several project
roots. That gives request routing, the UI project picker, host+user
isolation, and concurrent-project behaviors a shared fixture to exercise in
one run.

| TC-009.7 | Video file produced | `demo-output/` contains a `.webm` video file | Implemented |

### TC-010: Project Registry and Scoped Routing

Ownership is split across layers. HTTP API, registry shape, singleton
fallback, isolation, and MCP coverage are Go-side — owned by
`cli/internal/server/server_test.go` and its companions. The UI project
picker is SvelteKit-side — owned by `cli/internal/server/frontend/e2e/navigation.spec.ts`.
Dedicated `projects.spec.ts` is intentionally not restored post-Svelte
migration; the equivalent coverage is split across `navigation.spec.ts`
(project picker) and the Go tests (HTTP + MCP contract).

| ID | Test | Acceptance | Status |
|----|------|------------|--------|
| TC-010.1 | Registry loads | `GET /api/projects` lists each configured project root with a default marker | Implemented — `cli/internal/server/server_test.go` |
| TC-010.2 | Scoped API requests | `GET /api/projects/:project/beads` and sibling routes resolve the selected project context | Implemented — `cli/internal/server/server_test.go` |
| TC-010.3 | UI project picker | The web UI shows a project picker when more than one project is registered | Implemented — `cli/internal/server/frontend/e2e/navigation.spec.ts` TC-004, TC-005 |
| TC-010.4 | Singleton fallback | A single-project server still serves the legacy unscoped routes and dashboard | Implemented — `cli/internal/server/server_test.go` |
| TC-010.5 | Isolation | A malformed or missing project root reports degraded status without blocking healthy sibling projects | Implemented — `cli/internal/server/server_test.go` |
| TC-010.6 | Registry shape | Duplicate project ids fail registry loading before serving partial context | Planned — Go server tests |
| TC-010.7 | MCP registry listing | `ddx_list_projects` lists the registered projects and marks the default project | Implemented — `cli/internal/server/server_test.go` |
| TC-010.8 | MCP project lookup | `ddx_show_project` resolves the selected project context and returns the matching project metadata | Implemented — `cli/internal/server/server_test.go` |
| TC-010.9 | MCP scoped tool call | A project-aware MCP tool call runs against the selected project and returns that project's data | Implemented — `cli/internal/server/server_test.go` |

### TC-011: Host+User State and Node Identity

Verifies that `ddx-server` runs as a per-user host daemon with state at
`~/.local/share/ddx/server-state.json` and writes `~/.local/share/ddx/server.addr`,
per FEAT-020. These cases are owned by the Go server tests in
`cli/internal/server/server_test.go` (and companion `node_state_test.go`).

| ID | Test | Acceptance | Status |
|----|------|------------|--------|
| TC-011.1 | State file location | Server writes `server-state.json` under `XDG_DATA_HOME/ddx` (not inside `.ddx/server/`) | Implemented |
| TC-011.2 | Addr file location | Server writes `server.addr` with URL, node name, and node ID under `XDG_DATA_HOME/ddx` | Implemented |
| TC-011.3 | Node identity endpoint | `GET /api/node` returns a stable `node-<hash>` ID derived from hostname or `DDX_NODE_NAME` | Implemented |
| TC-011.4 | State survives restart | Projects registered before a restart are still returned by `GET /api/projects` after restart | Implemented |
| TC-011.5 | CLI auto-registration | Running `ddx bead list` in a fresh project directory causes that project to appear in `GET /api/projects` within 1s | Planned |
| TC-011.6 | Single instance per host | A second `ddx server` start overwrites the addr file and the first instance does not continue serving the addr | Implemented |

### TC-012: Host+User Project Isolation and Concurrency

Verifies that one host+user server can serve multiple projects concurrently
without cross-project leakage, per SD-019. Owned entirely by the Go server
tests in `cli/internal/server/server_test.go` — isolation is a server
contract, not a UI surface.

| ID | Test | Acceptance | Status |
|----|------|------------|--------|
| TC-012.1 | Bead isolation | `GET /api/projects/proj-a/beads` and `GET /api/projects/proj-b/beads` return disjoint bead sets from each project's own store | Implemented — `cli/internal/server/server_test.go` |
| TC-012.2 | Document isolation | A document present only in project A is not visible via project B's documents endpoint | Implemented — `cli/internal/server/server_test.go` |
| TC-012.3 | Concurrent requests | Parallel requests against different registered projects complete successfully without racing on adapters or caches | Implemented — `cli/internal/server/server_test.go` |
| TC-012.4 | Degraded project isolation | A malformed project root is reported as degraded in `GET /api/projects` while sibling projects continue serving | Implemented — `cli/internal/server/server_test.go` |
| TC-012.5 | Cache namespace | A cached lookup in project A does not surface the same key in project B | Implemented — `cli/internal/server/server_test.go` |

### TC-013: Execute-Loop Worker Lifecycle

Verifies that the in-process `WorkerManager` supervises execute-loop workers
as goroutines scoped to one project, per FEAT-002 and SD-019. These cases are
owned by `cli/internal/server/workers_test.go`.

| ID | Test | Acceptance | Status |
|----|------|------------|--------|
| TC-013.1 | Worker start | `StartExecuteLoop` against a registered project creates a worker record and starts a goroutine | Implemented |
| TC-013.2 | Live logs | `Logs` returns streaming log output while the worker is running | Implemented |
| TC-013.3 | Worker stop | `Stop` cancels the running worker and the on-disk record transitions to a terminal state | Implemented |
| TC-013.4 | Worker scope | A worker started for project A writes worker records and execution artifacts only under project A's `.ddx/workers/` and `.ddx/executions/<attempt-id>/` directories | Implemented |
| TC-013.5 | Replay-backed attempts | Runtime metrics (harness, model, tokens, cost, base_rev, result_rev) are persisted into the project's `.ddx/executions/<attempt-id>/` bundle per FEAT-014 | Planned |
| TC-013.6 | Concurrent workers | Workers for two different registered projects run in parallel without cross-project filesystem writes | Implemented |
