# Alignment Review: Post-Evolution Reconciliation

**Date:** 2026-04-06
**Scope:** Full repo — vision and PRD evolution
**Status:** Complete
**Epic:** ddx-24eefcfe

## Scope and Governing Artifacts

This review reconciles the planning stack after the vision and PRD were evolved
to incorporate strategic design discussion outcomes. The evolution added:

- Core thesis, differentiators, and design philosophy to the product vision
- Six new PRD goals (10-14 primary, 1 secondary)
- Four new feature references (FEAT-015 through FEAT-018)
- Expanded problem statement, risks, non-goals, and success criteria

**Governing artifacts reviewed:**

| Artifact | ID | Status |
|----------|-----|--------|
| Product Vision | product-vision | Updated to v2.0.0 |
| PRD | helix.prd | Updated to v4.0.0 |
| FEAT-001 CLI | FEAT-001 | In Progress |
| FEAT-002 Server | FEAT-002 | Not Started |
| FEAT-004 Beads | FEAT-004 | Complete |

| FEAT-017 Adversarial Review | — | No spec file |
| FEAT-018 Plugin API | — | No spec file |

## Intent Summary

**Vision (v2.0.0):** DDx is a toolkit/platform for document-driven agentic
software development. Unopinionated about methodology — plugins bring opinions.
Core thesis: documentation as abstraction produces better agent-written
software. Key differentiators vs vibe coding, code-only tools, and traditional
DDD. Design philosophy: multi-directional iteration, human-agent control
slider, self-documenting workflows, platform-not-opinions.

**PRD (v4.0.0):** Three artifacts (CLI, server, website). 14 primary goals
(up from 9), 3 secondary goals (up from 2). New capabilities: feedback loops,
measurement, adversarial review, plugin API stability. Explicit boundary:
DDx provides metric collection hooks and feedback infrastructure; plugins
define what to measure and how to act on feedback.

## Planning Stack Findings

| Finding | Classification | Evidence | Resolution |
|---------|---------------|----------|------------|
| FEAT-015 through FEAT-018 referenced in PRD but no spec files exist | UNDERSPECIFIED | PRD lines 50-57; no files in features/ | Write spec files |
| FEAT-016 (measurement) overlaps with FEAT-010 metric projections | UNDERSPECIFIED | FEAT-010 "domain-specific projections (metrics)"; PRD goal 12 "bead lifecycle metrics, cost tracking" | Clarify boundary: FEAT-010 owns exec-based metrics, FEAT-016 owns bead lifecycle and cost metrics |
| principles.md uses `dun:` frontmatter, not `ddx:` | STALE_PLAN | `docs/helix/01-frame/principles.md:2` — `dun: id: helix.workflow.principles` | Migrate to ddx: prefix |
| Vision lacks `depends_on` in frontmatter (nothing upstream) | ALIGNED | Vision is the root artifact — no upstream dependency expected | No action |
| PRD `depends_on: product-vision` correctly references vision | ALIGNED | `docs/helix/01-frame/prd.md:4` | No action |
| All FEAT-001 through FEAT-014 have spec files | ALIGNED | 14 files in `features/` | No action |
| Vision platform-vs-plugin boundary table matches PRD non-goals | ALIGNED | Vision "Platform Services, Not Opinions" table; PRD non-goals | No action |
| Optimization loop ownership unresolved | UNDERSPECIFIED | Evolution prompt §5 open question; PRD risk "resolve before plugin API v1" | Needs ADR |
| Prior alignment gaps (server mutations, CI, demos) still open | INCOMPLETE | AR-2026-04-05-repo.md execution issues | Carry forward |
| FEAT-XXX (installation architecture) has no assigned number | INCOMPLETE | `FEAT-XXX-installation-architecture.md` | Assign number |

## Execution Order and Critical Path

**Wave 1 — Spec writing (parallel, no blockers):**
- G1: FEAT-015 spec
- G2: FEAT-016 spec
- G3: FEAT-017 spec
- G4: FEAT-018 spec

**Wave 2 — Design decisions (after Wave 1):**
- G5: Optimization loop ADR (depends on FEAT-016 and FEAT-018 scoping)

**Wave 3 — Housekeeping (independent):**
- G6: Frontmatter migration
- G7: FEAT-XXX numbering

**Critical path:** G1-G4 (spec writing) → G5 (ADR) → implementation.
The four spec files are the highest priority deliverables from this evolution.
Carried-forward gaps (C1-C7) continue on their own existing execution paths.
