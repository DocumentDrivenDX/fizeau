# Feature: Git Awareness and Revision Control Integration

**ID:** FEAT-012
**Status:** Complete
**Priority:** P1
**Owner:** DDx Team

## Overview

DDx operates on files that live in git repositories. Several DDx capabilities
require git awareness beyond "git is the user's problem":

- Protecting spec documents from loss during rapid agent editing
- Tracking document changes for the staleness model
- Enabling MCP/UI clients to commit edits they make to documents
- Providing document history to agents inspecting how specs evolved

DDx is not replacing git. It is adding a thin, deliberate integration layer
that makes git operations available where DDx operations need them — commit
checkpointing, history queries, and safe write-then-commit workflows.

## Problem Statement

**Current situation:**
- Agents edit spec documents rapidly, sometimes overwriting each other's work
  or losing changes when context windows reset
- `ddx doc stamp` records content hashes but has no awareness of when a
  document was last committed vs merely saved
- The MCP server is read-only; a client that wants to edit a document via MCP
  has no way to commit the change
- The web UI (FEAT-008) can't offer "save" functionality without a commit path
- Document history requires manual `git log` — no DDx surface for it

**Desired outcome:** DDx operations that modify tracked files can auto-commit
to protect work. MCP and UI clients can write and commit documents through
DDx. Agents can query document revision history to understand how specs
evolved.

## User Scenarios

### S1: Agent Rapidly Editing Spec Documents (early commit)

An agent is evolving multiple spec documents in a `helix evolve` session. It
updates the PRD, two feature specs, and a solution design. Between each edit,
DDx should checkpoint the change to git so that:

- If the agent crashes or the session ends, no edits are lost
- Each document's change is individually attributable in history
- Concurrent agents on other branches don't conflict with uncommitted state

**Trigger:** Any DDx operation that writes to a tracked document (e.g.,
`ddx doc stamp`, future `ddx doc edit`, MCP write tools) should offer or
default to auto-commit.

**Design constraint:** Early commits should be lightweight (no hooks, fast).
The user or workflow can squash/rebase later. The important thing is that
changes survive.

### S2: Document Graph Tracking Changes Over Time

`ddx doc stale` currently computes staleness from content hashes recorded in
frontmatter stamps. But the interesting question is often "when did this
document last change relative to its dependencies?" — which requires git
history.

**Scenarios:**
- "Show me documents that changed in the last 5 commits" — useful for
  detecting what's in play
- "When was this document last modified?" — git log, not file mtime
- "What changed between the current stamp and the current content?" — diff
  from stamped hash to working copy
- "Which documents changed since tag v0.2.0?" — release-scoped staleness

**Design constraint:** These are read queries against git history. DDx wraps
them with document-graph semantics (artifact IDs, dependency relationships)
rather than raw file paths.

### S3: MCP Client Edits a Document

An agent connected via MCP wants to update a feature spec. Today the server
is read-only. With git awareness:

1. Agent calls `ddx_doc_write` with artifact ID and new content
2. DDx writes the file to disk
3. DDx commits the change with a structured message (e.g., "docs: update
   FEAT-001 via MCP [agent: claude]")
4. The commit is immediately visible to other tools reading the repo

**Design constraint:** Write-then-commit must be atomic from the client's
perspective. If the commit fails, the write should be rolled back (or at
minimum, clearly reported as uncommitted).

### S4: Web UI Saves a Document Edit

A developer editing a document in the FEAT-008 web UI clicks "Save". This
is the same flow as S3 but via HTTP instead of MCP:

1. UI sends `PUT /api/docs/:id` with new content
2. Server writes the file
3. Server commits with attribution
4. UI shows "Saved and committed" or an error

### S5: Agent Inspects Document Evolution

An agent working on a feature wants to understand how the governing spec
evolved — what requirements were added, what changed, why. This is more
than "is it stale?" — it's "what happened?"

**Scenarios:**
- "Show me the last 5 changes to FEAT-001" — git log filtered by file path
- "What changed in FEAT-001 between v0.1.0 and now?" — diff between tags
- "Who last edited this document?" — git blame
- "Show me all documents that changed in this branch" — branch diff

### S6: Workflow Checkpoints Before and After Phases

A workflow tool wants to tag a known-good state before entering a
risky phase (e.g., before `helix build` modifies code). DDx can provide:

- `ddx checkpoint "pre-build"` — creates a lightweight git tag
- `ddx checkpoint --restore "pre-build"` — restores to that state

This is a thin wrapper over git tags, but named in DDx terms.

### S7: Bead Tracker Changes Are Committed

Agents create, update, and close beads throughout a work session. The bead
tracker file (`.ddx/beads.jsonl`) is project state that must be committed to
git — it records what work exists, who claimed it, and what's done.

**Current problem:** `.ddx/beads.jsonl` is not gitignored, but nothing in DDx
ensures it gets committed. Agents that don't know about this convention leave
bead changes uncommitted, leading to lost tracker state when sessions end or
branches switch.

**Required behavior:**
- DDx bead-mutating commands (`ddx bead create`, `update`, `close`, etc.)
  should auto-commit `beads.jsonl` after successful mutations (governed by the
  same `git.auto_commit` setting as document changes)
- `ddx install` should auto-commit plugin-related changes (skill symlinks,
  bead tracker updates)
- `ddx init` should generate agent guidance (in CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md) that
  instructs agents to commit `beads.jsonl` alongside code changes

**Design constraint:** Bead auto-commits should be lightweight. A single bead
mutation produces one commit. Batch operations (e.g., `ddx bead import`)
produce one commit for the whole batch.

### S8: Agent Guidance Generated on Init

`ddx init` should produce agent-facing guidance that ensures agents commit
DDx-managed state files. Without this, agents treat `.ddx/beads.jsonl` and
skill symlinks as untracked noise.

**Minimum guidance:**
- `.ddx/beads.jsonl` should be committed after bead mutations
- `.agents/skills/` and `.claude/skills/` should be committed after
  `ddx install` (already implemented)
- `.ddx/config.yaml` and `.ddx/versions.yaml` should be committed on init
  (already implemented)

The guidance can be injected into CLAUDE.md (extending the existing
metaprompt injection) or generated as a standalone AGENTS.md.

## Requirements

### Functional

**Early commit (S1, S3, S4, S7)**
1. DDx operations that write tracked files can auto-commit the change
2. Auto-commit is configurable: `always` (default for MCP/UI writes),
   `prompt` (ask user), `never` (opt out)
3. Commit messages follow a structured format:
   `docs(<artifact-id>): <description> [ddx: <operation>]`
4. MCP write tools (`ddx_doc_write`) commit by default
5. HTTP write endpoints (`PUT /api/docs/:id`) commit by default

**History queries (S2, S5)**
6. `ddx doc history <id> [--since <ref>]` — show commit log for an artifact
7. `ddx doc diff <id> [<ref1>] [<ref2>]` — show content diff between refs
8. `ddx doc changed [--since <ref>]` — list artifacts changed since a ref
9. MCP tools: `ddx_doc_history`, `ddx_doc_diff`, `ddx_doc_changed`
10. HTTP endpoints: `GET /api/docs/:id/history`, `GET /api/docs/:id/diff`

**Checkpoints (S6)**
11. `ddx checkpoint <name>` — create lightweight git tag with DDx prefix
12. `ddx checkpoint --list` — list DDx checkpoints
13. `ddx checkpoint --restore <name>` — restore working tree to checkpoint

**Bead tracker auto-commit (S7)**
14. `ddx bead` mutating commands auto-commit `.ddx/beads.jsonl` after
    successful operations (governed by `git.auto_commit`)
15. `ddx install` auto-commits plugin artifacts (skill symlinks, tracker
    changes) with `chore: install <name> <version>` message
16. Batch bead operations produce one commit, not one per record

**Agent guidance generation (S8)**
17. `ddx init` injects agent guidance into CLAUDE.md (or generates AGENTS.md)
    that instructs agents to commit DDx-managed state files:
    `.ddx/beads.jsonl`, `.ddx/config.yaml`, `.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`
18. The guidance is part of the metaprompt injection and is updated on
    `ddx init --force`

**Configuration**
19. `git.auto_commit` in `.ddx/config.yaml`: `always`, `prompt`, `never`
20. `git.commit_prefix` for customizing commit message format
21. `git.checkpoint_prefix` for tag naming (default: `ddx/`)

**Execute-Bead Git Operations**

The general DDx git safety posture is conservative (see SD-012). One managed
exception exists: `ddx agent execute-bead` requires a controlled set of git
operations beyond the read-plus-commit baseline. These are explicitly permitted
only within the execute-bead workflow:

22. Checkpoint a dirty caller worktree before execution (creates a commit, does
    not discard changes)
23. Create an isolated temporary worktree from the resolved base revision
24. Rebase the execution branch onto the latest target branch tip — only to
    prepare a fast-forward landing, never for history rewriting
25. Fast-forward update the target branch when merge conditions are satisfied
26. Preserve non-landed iterations under hidden refs using the naming scheme:
    `refs/ddx/iterations/<bead-id>/<timestamp>-<base-shortsha>` where
    `<timestamp>` is `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ` (UTC compact ISO-8601, e.g.,
    `20260408T130000Z`) and `<base-shortsha>` is at least 12 characters
27. **No-orphan-worktree invariant:** Execution worktrees are always removed
    after the workflow completes (success, failure, or crash recovery); a crash
    during cleanup must not leave a persistent orphan worktree; the next
    execute-bead invocation detects and removes orphaned worktrees matching the
    execute-bead path pattern before proceeding
28. Hidden refs are local and not pushed by DDx; preserved iterations can be
    enumerated with `git for-each-ref 'refs/ddx/iterations/<bead-id>/*'`
29. Epic-scoped execution may create one persistent managed worktree and one
    branch named after the epic, such as `ddx/epics/<epic-id>`, and reuse that
    worktree across sequential child-bead executions for that epic
30. Child-bead commits on an epic branch are ordinary commits on that branch;
    they are not fast-forward landed directly to the target branch
31. The completed epic branch lands to the target branch with a regular merge
    commit so the child-bead commit history remains intact
32. Epic merge-gate executions run against the merge candidate before the merge
    commit is finalized
33. Epic worktrees are long-lived only for the lifetime of an active epic
    worker; once the epic is merged, abandoned, or reset, DDx must remove the
    managed epic worktree and leave no orphaned epic worktree behind
34. **Tracked execution-evidence bundle.** Each execute-bead attempt writes
    a tracked bundle at `.ddx/executions/<attempt-id>/` containing at least
    `prompt.md`, `manifest.json`, and `result.json` per FEAT-006
    §"Execute-Bead Evidence Bundle". The bundle is committed as part of the
    iteration (landed or preserved under the hidden ref in requirement 26).
    The DDx default `.gitignore` template and git safety posture must not
    exclude `.ddx/executions/` from tracking; only the ignored runtime
    scratch paths listed in FEAT-006 may be excluded.
35. **Canonical commit provenance trailers.** Each iteration commit
    (landed or preserved) carries the canonical Git trailer set defined in
    FEAT-006 §"Canonical Git trailers": `Ddx-Attempt-Id`, `Ddx-Worker-Id`,
    `Ddx-Harness`, `Ddx-Model`, and `Ddx-Result-Status`. The git layer must
    preserve these trailers verbatim on rebase+fast-forward landing and on
    hidden-ref preservation; it must not rewrite, strip, or reorder them.
    Consumers of commit history rely on these trailer names as the stable
    provenance surface.

All other DDx git operations remain conservative: DDx does not force-push,
rebase outside execute-bead, delete branches, or amend commits outside this
managed flow.

**Epic branch and worktree naming rules**

Requirements 29–33 above establish that DDx may create a persistent epic
worktree and branch. The following naming and persistence rules pin down the
contract so external tools can observe epic state deterministically:

34. The epic branch name is `ddx/epics/<epic-id>`. The segment `<epic-id>` is
    the tracker id of the epic bead. DDx must not reuse this branch name for
    anything other than that epic.
35. The epic branch is created from the resolved base revision on the target
    branch the first time the epic worker launches for that epic, and is
    reused across subsequent launches of the same worker until the epic is
    merged, abandoned, or reset.
36. The epic worktree path follows a single managed pattern derived from the
    epic id so crash-recovery logic can match orphans by path. The worktree
    is attached to the epic branch and lives until the epic worker exits
    cleanly or the epic is reset.
37. Child-bead commits on the epic branch are ordinary commits (requirement
    30). A child bead may be closed in the tracker as soon as its acceptance
    and required gates pass in the epic branch context, even though its
    commit still lives only on `ddx/epics/<epic-id>` and has not yet reached
    the target branch. "Closed on epic" means the child work is finalized on
    the epic branch and is waiting for the epic merge, not that it has
    landed on the target branch.
38. Final integration of a completed epic uses `git merge --no-ff` from
    `ddx/epics/<epic-id>` into the target branch so the full child-commit
    history remains visible in target history. Fast-forwarding an epic
    branch into the target branch is not permitted.
39. Epic merge gates run against the merge candidate — the epic branch tip
    after it has been rebased onto the latest target tip — not against
    individual child commits. The merge commit is only created after those
    gates pass.
40. A failed epic merge gate preserves the epic branch and worktree for
    operator inspection; DDx must not silently discard an epic branch that
    failed to merge.

### Non-Functional

- **Safety:** Never force-push, rebase, or delete branches — except within the
  execute-bead managed flow (see requirements 22–28). Outside execute-bead, DDx
  only creates commits, tags, and reads history. Epic execution adds one
  further managed exception: a regular merge commit is permitted only when DDx
  lands a completed epic branch under the epic worker contract.
- **Performance:** History queries should use `--follow` for renamed files.
  Commit operations <500ms.
- **Compatibility:** Works with any git repo. No special git configuration
  required.
- **Graceful degradation:** If not in a git repo, history/commit features
  are disabled with clear messages. Core DDx functionality still works.

## Affected Existing Specs

|------|--------------|
| FEAT-002 (Server) | Remove "read-only for v1" constraint. Add write+commit endpoints for documents. |
| FEAT-007 (Doc Graph) | Remove "use git directly" from Out of Scope. Add history/diff/changed commands. |
| PRD | Add git awareness as a primary capability. |

## User Stories

### US-120: Agent Edits Are Protected by Auto-Commit
**As an** AI agent editing spec documents
**I want** DDx to auto-commit each document change
**So that** my edits survive session boundaries and crashes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given auto-commit is enabled, when I write a document via MCP, then a git
  commit is created with the artifact ID in the message
- Given two agents edit different documents, then each edit is a separate
  commit with clear attribution

### US-121: Developer Views Document History
**As a** developer reviewing a spec
**I want** to see how it evolved over recent commits
**So that** I understand what changed and why

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I run `ddx doc history FEAT-001`, then I see a log of commits that
  touched the FEAT-001 file with dates and messages
- Given I run `ddx doc diff FEAT-001 v0.1.0`, then I see the content diff
  since that tag

### US-122: MCP Client Writes and Commits a Document
**As an** MCP-connected agent
**I want** to update a document and have it committed atomically
**So that** my changes are durable and visible to other tools

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I call `ddx_doc_write` with an artifact ID and content, then the file
  is written and committed
- Given the commit fails (e.g., merge conflict), then I receive a clear error
  and the working tree is not left in a dirty state

### US-123: Workflow Creates Checkpoints
**As a** workflow tool
**I want** to tag a known-good state before risky operations
**So that** I can restore if something goes wrong

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I run `ddx checkpoint pre-build`, then a git tag `ddx/pre-build`
  is created
- Given I run `ddx checkpoint --restore pre-build`, then the working tree
  matches the tagged state

### US-124: Bead Changes Are Auto-Committed
**As an** AI agent managing work items
**I want** bead mutations to be committed automatically
**So that** tracker state survives session boundaries and is visible to other
agents and developers

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given auto-commit is enabled, when I run `ddx bead create "Fix login"`,
  then `.ddx/beads.jsonl` is committed with a structured message
- Given I run `ddx bead close hx-001`, then the bead state change is committed
- Given I run `ddx bead import`, then one commit is created for the entire
  batch, not one per record
- Given auto-commit is `never`, then bead commands do not create commits

### US-125: Init Generates Agent Guidance for Committing DDx State
**As a** developer setting up a project
**I want** `ddx init` to instruct agents about which files to commit
**So that** agents don't leave DDx state files uncommitted

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I run `ddx init`, then CLAUDE.md contains guidance listing
  `.ddx/beads.jsonl`, `.ddx/config.yaml`, `.agents/skills/`, and
  `.claude/skills/` as files that should be committed
- Given I run `ddx init --force`, then the guidance is refreshed
- Given an agent reads the generated guidance, then it knows to `git add`
  and commit `.ddx/beads.jsonl` after bead operations

### US-126: Execute-bead Git Lifecycle Is Safe and Contained
**As** a developer running execute-bead
**I want** the git operations to be controlled and leave my repo in a predictable state
**So that** my working tree is never lost or corrupted by an execute-bead run

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the caller's working tree has uncommitted changes when `ddx agent execute-bead` starts, when the workflow begins, then DDx creates a checkpoint commit from those changes and uses it as the effective base revision — the caller's staged and unstaged changes are not discarded or reset.
- Given `ddx agent execute-bead` runs, when it begins, then DDx creates a managed isolated worktree; when execution completes (success, failure, or crash recovery), then no worktree created by that execute-bead invocation remains in the filesystem.
- Given an iteration is merge-eligible, when DDx prepares a fast-forward landing, then the only rebase performed is a rebase of the execution branch onto the latest target branch tip — `git log --merges` shows no merge commit; history remains linear.
- Given an iteration is not merged (required execution failed, ratchet regression, or `--no-merge` set), when DDx preserves the iteration, then a ref matching `refs/ddx/iterations/<bead-id>/<timestamp>-<base-shortsha>` is created and the target branch is not updated.
- Given execute-bead left an orphan worktree due to a crash, when the next execute-bead invocation starts, then DDx detects and removes orphaned worktrees matching the execute-bead path pattern before proceeding.
- Given two execute-bead invocations on the same bead run concurrently or in rapid succession from the same base, then each produces a distinct hidden ref because the `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ-<12charsha>` combination is unique per invocation; DDx does not serialize or lock across concurrent invocations.

## Dependencies

- `internal/git` package (existing — basic git operations)
- FEAT-004 (beads — bead mutation operations)
- FEAT-007 (document graph — artifact ID to file path mapping)
- FEAT-009 (plugin registry — `ddx init` and `ddx install`)

Note: FEAT-002 (Server) depends on FEAT-012, not the reverse. FEAT-012 defines
the git mechanics (write+commit, history, checkpoints); FEAT-002 exposes those
capabilities as HTTP and MCP endpoints. The dependency runs FEAT-002 → FEAT-012.

## Out of Scope

- Branch management (creating, switching, merging branches)
- Remote operations (push, pull, fetch)
- Merge conflict resolution (report conflicts, don't resolve them)
- Git configuration management
- Submodule or subtree operations (handled by existing `ddx update/contribute`)
- **When to invoke execute-bead and what to do with the outcome** — DDx provides the git mechanics; workflow tools decide when to run execute-bead, whether to retry, and how to act on preserved vs landed iterations
- **Conflict classification and escalation** — whether a merge conflict is resolvable or requires escalation is a workflow tool policy decision, not a DDx git operation
