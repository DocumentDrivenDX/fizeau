## Problem

The personas page is read-only with no explanation of why. A reader cannot tell
whether the feature is unfinished or intentional, and teams who want a
project-flavored persona ("our code-reviewer, with our opinions") have no
sanctioned path: they can fork the library file and push it upstream
(inappropriate), never customize (bad outcomes), or scatter ad-hoc files.

## D1 — Policy: library vs project content

Personas can live in two places:

- **Library personas** — `<library>/personas/*.md`. Shipped with DDx, shared
  across projects, pulled via `ddx update`, contributed upstream via
  `ddx contribute`. **Read-only in UI and API.** Edits are refused with a
  typed error; the only mutation affecting library content is `fork`, which
  copies the file into the project.

- **Project-local personas** — `.ddx/personas/*.md` under the project root.
  Live with the project in its VCS. Fully editable via UI, GraphQL, and CLI.
  Never pushed upstream by `ddx contribute`.

### Override rule

When a project-local persona has the same name as a library persona, the
project-local file wins for that project's bindings and list views. List
views expose one effective persona per name; the source badge becomes
`project` for an override so the reader can see that project-local content
is active. Load order: project first, then library; duplicate names collapse
to the project-local file.

### What this does not decide

- Multi-project / org-level persona sharing — out of scope.
- Rich in-browser markdown editor — a plain `<textarea>` is enough for v1.
- Upstreaming project personas — still happens via `ddx contribute`.
- Changing how personas get injected into agent prompts — server read path
  is unchanged.

## D2 — UI scope

Minimum viable additions to
`/nodes/.../projects/.../personas`:

1. **Explainer copy** in the page header. Two sentences: what personas are,
   and how library vs project sources differ.
2. **Source badge** on each row: `library` or `project`.
3. **New persona** button opens a form (name, roles, description, tags,
   body). Creates `.ddx/personas/<name>.md` with YAML frontmatter.
4. **Edit** affordance on project-source rows only.
5. **Delete** affordance on project-source rows only, with confirm.
6. **Fork to project** action on library-source rows. Copies the library
   file to `.ddx/personas/<name>.md`; if a collision exists, the form
   defaults to `<name>-local`.
7. **Empty-project hint** when no project personas exist: "No project
   personas yet. Fork a library persona or create a new one."
8. **Existing bind flow is untouched.**

## CLI parity (D3)

Same operations surfaced through:

- `ddx persona new <name>` — scaffold `.ddx/personas/<name>.md`.
- `ddx persona edit <name>` — open `$EDITOR` on the project-local file;
  errors on library personas.
- `ddx persona fork <library-name> [--as <new-name>]` — copy library into
  project.
- `ddx persona delete <name>` — project-only; errors on library.

UI and CLI share the same `cli/internal/persona` operations:
`CreateProjectPersona`, `UpdateProjectPersona`, `DeleteProjectPersona`,
`ForkPersonaToProject`. No duplicated write logic.

## Error model

All project-mutating operations check source first:

- If the target persona's source is `library`, return
  `PersonaError{Type: ErrorReadOnlyLibrary}` with message
  `"persona <name> is a library persona and cannot be <op>; fork it first"`.
- If the project file already exists on create, return
  `PersonaError{Type: ErrorAlreadyExists}`.
- If the project file does not exist on update/delete, return
  `PersonaError{Type: ErrorPersonaNotFound}`.

GraphQL mutations surface these as typed errors so the UI can show a
targeted message.
