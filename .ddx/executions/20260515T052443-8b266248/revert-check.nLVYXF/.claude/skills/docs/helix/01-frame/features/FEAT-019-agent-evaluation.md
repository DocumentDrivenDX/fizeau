# Feature: DDx Agent Evaluation and Prompt Comparison

**ID:** FEAT-019
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** P1
**Owner:** DDx Team

## Overview

DDx can dispatch the same prompt to multiple agent harnesses and capture
structured results. This feature adds the evaluation surface: sandboxed
comparison runs that capture side effects, automated grading of outputs,
and comparison records that make prompt quality measurable.

This is deliberately an **optional evaluation and reporting layer** built on
top of the `ddx agent execute-bead` primitive (FEAT-006). The primary
bead-execution workflow is `execute-bead`, which runs an agent, evaluates
required executions, and lands or preserves the iteration. FEAT-019 provides:
compare, grade, replay, and benchmark capabilities over those preserved
iterations — it does not define a competing foundational execution model.

### Ownership split

- **FEAT-006** owns `execute-bead` (the canonical bead execution workflow),
  comparison dispatch (`ddx agent run --compare`), `ComparisonRecord`
  persistence, and arm execution mechanics.
- **FEAT-019** (this spec) owns **grading**, **replay**, and
  **benchmark suite execution** — the evaluation and reporting layer built
  on top of execute-bead preserved iterations and comparison dispatch.
- **FEAT-010** owns the generic exec substrate. Comparison records may
  use FEAT-010 storage if needed but comparison dispatch is not an exec
  projection — it has a fundamentally different shape (N parallel arms
  vs one sequential run).
- **FEAT-004** owns bead semantics including evidence. FEAT-019 adds
  evidence fields (session linkage) but does not modify bead close
  behavior.

### Relationship to execute-bead

`ddx agent execute-bead` is the primary primitive for agent-driven bead
execution. FEAT-019 replay and benchmark capabilities are built on preserved
`execute-bead` iterations: multiple `execute-bead --no-merge` attempts from
the same base produce a corpus that FEAT-019 can compare, grade, and report
on. "Try N ideas on this bead and pick the best" is a workflow plugin loop
that calls `execute-bead --no-merge` repeatedly and then uses FEAT-019
evaluation primitives — it is not a DDx execution mode.

### Relationship to workflow tools

DDx owns the comparison, grading, and replay primitives. Workflow plugins own
the policies that use them: when to experiment, which variables to sweep,
quality gates using experiment results, automatic model selection, and
exploration loops. "Try 10 ideas to improve metric X" is a workflow plugin loop
that calls DDx comparison primitives — it is not a DDx execution mode.

## Problem Statement

**Current situation:**
- `ddx agent run` can dispatch to any harness and capture output/tokens/cost.
- Quorum mode runs multiple harnesses and checks consensus (pass/fail).
- DDx Agent gives DDx full control of the agent loop with tool call logging.
- Beads define work. Commits capture verified results. But there is no
  structured way to compare harness outputs for the same prompt, replay a
  bead with a different model, or grade the quality of results.

**Pain points:**
- When evaluating whether a local model (via DDx Agent) can replace a cloud
  model for a task class, there's no structured way to compare.
- Side-effecting agent runs (file writes, shell commands) can't be safely
  compared without isolation — running two agents in the same worktree
  produces interference.
- No way to answer "is this prompt good enough?" without manual review.
- Closed beads don't record which model/harness produced the result, so
  replaying with a different model requires manual prompt reconstruction.

**Desired outcome:** Comparison, grading, and replay primitives that let
operators answer: "For this prompt, how does harness A compare to harness
B?" and "What if we reran this bead with a different model?" — with
concrete artifacts (diffs, outputs, grades) — automatically and repeatably.

The canonical architecture is
[`SD-023`](../../02-design/solution-designs/SD-023-agent-evaluation.md).

## Requirements

### Functional

**Sandboxed comparison dispatch**
1. `ddx agent run --compare --harnesses=agent,claude --prompt task.md` runs
   each harness arm in an isolated environment and records a comparison.
2. Each arm runs in a temporary git worktree created from the current HEAD.
   Existing `resolveWorktree` infrastructure is reused.
3. After each arm completes, capture `git diff HEAD` in the worktree as the
   "effect diff" — the concrete artifact of what the agent changed.
4. For DDx Agent arms, also capture the full `ToolCallLog` (every read, write,
   edit, bash call with inputs and outputs).
5. For subprocess arms (codex, claude, opencode), capture stdout/stderr and
   the effect diff. Tool call detail is not available.
6. Temporary worktrees are cleaned up after the comparison unless
   `--keep-sandbox` is specified.
7. Arms run in parallel by default (reuses quorum parallelism). Sequential
   mode available via `--sequential` for resource-constrained environments.

**Side-effect capture**
8. The effect diff is captured as a unified diff string and stored in the
   comparison record alongside the text output.
9. For DDx Agent, the tool call log provides a complete audit trail: which files
   were read, what edits were made, what commands were run, what output they
   produced. This is richer than the diff alone.
10. Optionally run a test suite in each worktree after the agent completes
    (`--post-run "make test"`) and capture pass/fail as a quality signal.

**Grading primitive**
11. `ddx agent grade --comparison <id>` sends a comparison record to a
    grading harness and records the evaluation.
12. `ddx agent grade --comparison <id> --grader claude` specifies which
    harness performs the grading (default: highest-preference available).
13. The grading prompt is a standardized template that presents:
    - The original task prompt
    - Each arm's text output
    - Each arm's effect diff
    - (Optional) test results
14. The grader returns a structured evaluation per arm:
    ```json
    {
      "arm": "agent",
      "score": 7,
      "max_score": 10,
      "pass": true,
      "rationale": "Correct implementation but missed edge case in..."
    }
    ```
15. Grades are appended to the comparison record in the session log.
16. Custom grading rubrics can be provided via `--rubric <file>` to
    replace the default template. DDx provides the rubric loading
    mechanism; the rubric content is user/workflow-defined.

**Comparison reporting**
17. `ddx agent compare --list` shows recent comparison runs with summary.
18. `ddx agent compare --show <id>` displays the full comparison record
    including per-arm outputs, diffs, and grades.
19. `--format json` for machine-readable output (consumed by dun checks,
    workflow evaluation gates, CI pipelines).

**Benchmark suites**
19a. `ddx agent benchmark --suite <path>` loads a JSON suite definition
     with arms (harness/model/tier configurations) and prompts, runs all
     prompts across all arms, and produces aggregate per-arm statistics.
19b. Suite format: `BenchmarkSuite` JSON with `name`, `version`, `arms[]`,
     `prompts[]`, optional `sandbox`, `post_run`, `timeout`.
19c. Output: per-arm summary (completed, failed, total tokens, cost,
     avg duration) plus full comparison records per prompt.
19d. `--output <path>` saves full results as JSON for historical tracking.

**Bead-session linkage** (foundation for replay)
20. When a bead is closed after an agent run, record the `session_id` (from
    `sessions.jsonl`) and `closing_commit_sha` as bead evidence. The session
    already owns model, harness, tokens, and cost — do not duplicate those
    fields on the bead. `ddx bead show` resolves agent metadata from the
    linked session.
21. If no session link is recorded (manual close, legacy beads), replay
    still works but reports "baseline session unknown" and cannot provide
    a diff comparison.

**Replay from bead**
22. `ddx agent replay <bead-id> --model <model> --harness <harness>` is the
    key primitive for answering "what if we reran this bead with a different
    model?"
23. Replay reconstructs the original prompt from the linked session (not from
    bead prose). If the session is unavailable, falls back to bead
    title/description/acceptance as a degraded prompt.
24. Replay base state: by default, replay checks out the `closing_commit_sha`
    parent (the state before the original implementation). `--at-head` mode
    replays against current HEAD instead ("would this model solve the task
    today?"). The default answers "would this model have produced the same
    result then?"
    For tracker-only backfills, do not point `closing_commit_sha` at a later
    metadata-only close commit; omit the field so replay falls back to the
    sessionless/manual baseline instead of pretending the metadata commit was
    the governed implementation diff.
25. Replay runs in a sandbox worktree, captures diff, runs `--post-run`
    evaluation, and reports a comparison of the new diff against the
    original commit's diff.

### Non-Functional

- **Isolation:** Worktree sandboxes must prevent cross-arm interference.
  Each arm sees a clean copy of HEAD.
- **Performance:** Parallel arm execution. Worktree creation is fast
  (git worktree add is <1s for typical repos).
- **Storage:** Comparison records include diffs and outputs which can be
  large. Use the same attachment-backed storage as session logs (FEAT-006).
- **Determinism:** For DDx Agent with the virtual provider, comparison runs
  are fully deterministic — enables CI-based prompt regression testing.

## Design Principles

### Platform primitive, not framework

DDx provides the mechanics:
- Run N harnesses on the same prompt in sandboxes
- Capture outputs and side effects
- Send results to a grading harness
- Record everything

DDx does **not** provide:
- Prompt optimization strategies
- Benchmark suites or leaderboards
- Model selection policies
- Grading rubric content (beyond a sensible default)

Workflow tools compose these primitives. For example, a workflow plugin might
define: "Before promoting a bead, run the implementation prompt through
agent+claude, require grade ≥8/10 on both arms." A check runner might define:
"regression-test this prompt against the recorded baseline."

### Sandboxing strategy

Git worktrees are the natural sandbox for code-generating agents:
- Fast to create (copy-on-write on modern filesystems)
- Full git state (HEAD, index, config, hooks)
- Clean isolation (separate working directory)
- Cheap to clean up (`git worktree remove`)
- Diff capture is trivial (`git diff HEAD`)

For DDx Agent specifically, the tool sandbox is already built into the
`WorkDir` parameter — setting it to the worktree path is sufficient.
For subprocess harnesses, `WorkDirFlag` (codex: `-C`, opencode: `--dir`)
achieves the same.

No container or VM sandboxing is needed for comparison runs because:
- The threat model is "prevent cross-arm interference," not "prevent
  malicious code execution"
- Worktrees provide filesystem isolation
- Network isolation is out of scope (agents need API access)

If stronger isolation is needed (e.g., untrusted model output running
shell commands), that's a future concern addressed by DDx Agent's tool
permission layer or external sandbox tooling.

### Configuration

```yaml
# .ddx/config.yaml
agent:
  compare:
    default_grader: claude         # harness to use for grading
    keep_sandbox: false            # preserve worktrees after comparison
    parallel: true                 # run arms in parallel
    post_run: ""                   # command to run after each arm
```

## User Stories

### US-190: Developer Compares Local vs Cloud Model
**As a** developer evaluating whether a local model can handle a task class
**I want** to run the same prompt through DDx Agent (local) and claude (cloud)
**So that** I can see concrete differences in output quality and cost

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I run `ddx agent run --compare --harnesses=agent,claude --prompt task.md`,
  then both harnesses receive the same prompt text
- Given both arms complete, then I see a comparison summary with per-arm
  output, tokens, cost, and duration
- Given I add `--keep-sandbox`, then I can inspect the worktree contents
  after the run

### US-191: Developer Grades Agent Outputs
**As a** developer assessing prompt quality
**I want** to have a smart model grade the outputs of a comparison run
**So that** I get a structured quality score without manual review

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a completed comparison, when I run `ddx agent grade --comparison <id>`,
  then a grading harness evaluates each arm
- Given the grading completes, then each arm has a score, pass/fail, and
  rationale in the comparison record
- Given I specify `--rubric custom.md`, then the custom rubric replaces
  the default grading template

### US-192: CI Pipeline Runs Prompt Regression Test
**As a** CI system ensuring prompt quality
**I want** to compare agent outputs against a recorded baseline
**So that** prompt changes that degrade quality are caught before merge

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a comparison with `--harnesses=agent` and the virtual provider
  baseline, when the DDx Agent output diverges significantly, then the
  comparison record reflects the difference
- Given `--format json` output, then CI can parse the comparison and
  fail the pipeline on grade regression

### US-193: Developer Captures Side Effects Safely
**As a** developer running comparison experiments
**I want** each agent arm to run in an isolated worktree
**So that** file changes from one arm don't contaminate the other or my
working tree

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I run a comparison with two harnesses that both edit files, then
  each arm's changes are captured as separate diffs
- Given the comparison completes, then my original working tree is
  unchanged
- Given an arm fails mid-run, then its worktree is still cleaned up
  (unless `--keep-sandbox`)

### US-194: Developer Replays a Bead With a Different Model
**As a** developer evaluating local model capability
**I want** to rerun a previously-closed bead with a different model
**So that** I can compare the new model's output against the known-good result

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a closed bead with a linked session, when I run
  `ddx agent replay <bead-id> --model qwen3.5-27b --harness agent`,
  then the original prompt is reconstructed from the session and dispatched
- Given the replay completes in a sandbox worktree checked out at the
  parent of `closing_commit_sha`, then I see the diff compared against
  the original commit's diff
- Given `--at-head`, the replay runs against current HEAD instead
- Given a bead without a linked session, then replay falls back to bead
  prose and reports "baseline session unknown"

### US-195: Bead Links to Agent Session on Close
**As a** developer building a replay corpus
**I want** bead close to record the session ID and closing commit
**So that** future replays can reconstruct the exact prompt and baseline

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given an agent run closes bead ddx-xxx, then `session_id` and
  `closing_commit_sha` are recorded as bead evidence
- Given `ddx bead show ddx-xxx`, then model/harness/tokens/cost are
  resolved from the linked session (not stored on the bead)
- Given a bead closed without an agent run, then no session link exists
  and `ddx bead show` omits agent metadata

### US-196: Evaluation Primitives Consume Preserved Execute-bead Iterations
**As** a developer evaluating bead execution quality
**I want** FEAT-019 evaluation tools to operate on preserved execute-bead iterations
**So that** comparison, grading, and benchmarking build on execute-bead results rather than a competing execution model

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given multiple `ddx agent execute-bead <id> --no-merge` runs from the same base revision exist, when `ddx agent compare` or `ddx agent benchmark` consumes them, then those preserved iterations are valid inputs — no separate evaluation-specific execution path is required to produce the corpus.
- Given an evaluation consumes a preserved execute-bead iteration, when provenance is inspected, then it traces back to the originating execute-bead session ID and hidden ref — no evaluation-owned provenance record duplicates execute-bead evidence.

## Dependencies

- FEAT-006 (Agent Service) — harness registry, quorum parallelism, worktree
  support, session logging, comparison dispatch
- FEAT-014 (Token Awareness) — token/cost tracking per arm
- FEAT-012 (Git Awareness) — git worktree operations
- DDx Agent library — embedded agent with tool call logging

## Out of Scope

- **Exec projection** — comparison is a peer to FEAT-010 exec, not a
  child. Do not model comparisons as exec runs.
- **Exploration loops** — "try 10 ideas to improve metric X" is a workflow
  plugin loop that calls DDx comparison primitives, not a DDx execution mode.
- **Model selection policies** — workflow tools decide which model for which
  task based on comparison results. DDx provides the data.
- **Prompt optimization** — automatic prompt rewriting is out of scope.
  DDx provides comparison and grading; plugins provide the iteration loop.
- **Structured git trailers** — bead + session log already have the data.
  Don't duplicate into git commit metadata.
- **Autonomy semantics and exploration policy** — DDx does not define what autonomy levels mean or when to run experiments; those are delegated to workflow tools
- **Escalation and supervisory rules** — whether to accept a result, retry, or escalate is workflow tool policy; DDx provides the comparison and grading data
- Container or VM-level sandboxing
- Cross-repo or cross-project comparison
